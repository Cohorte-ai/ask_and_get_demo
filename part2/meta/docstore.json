Low Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) [ 14] is one of the most widely adopted methods for fine-tuning LLMs,\nshowing significant promise for enabling smaller, specialized models to outperform larger,\nmore general models on specific tasks, with a fraction of trainable parameters, challenging\nthe notion that bigger general models always outperform smaller ones.\nDespite the rapid advancement and release of new base models, such as Gemma [ 36],\nLlama [37], and Mistral [ 15], which claim ease of fine-tuning across various tasks, compre-\nhensive evaluations of these models remain scarce. Broad knowledge and reasoning-based\nbenchmarks like MMLU [ 11] and HellaSwag [ 44] are commonly used in leaderboards like the\nOpen LLM Leaderboard [ 2], however, this is not necessarily representative of task-specific\nperformance, before or after fine-tuning. Technical reports [ 36,37,15,26,35] often leave\ntraining configurations unspecified, with claims of ease of fine-tuning left unmeasured. While\nthe effectiveness of fine-tuning has been broadly demonstrated [ 17,45], the lack of large-scale\nexperimentation leaves several pivotal questions unanswered, particularly regarding the\nconsistency and predictability of performance improvements through fine-tuning, and the\nimpact of model size, base model, and task complexity.\nEvaluations are sensitive to prompting, and there are significant variation in the formulations\nused in publications and libraries1. Technical reports often showcase model performance\nusing specialized, dataset-specific prompting strategies such as role-playing prompts (e.g.\n\"Assume you are an expert\" ),maj@kvoting [40], varied n-shot [ 34], MedPrompt [ 25],\nand chain-of-thought [ 43] prompting. While these methods are intended to highlight the\noptimal capabilities of models, the use of such diverse prompting techniques can make direct\ncomparisons across models and tasks challenging.\nIn this work, we seek to bridge these gaps by conducting an extensive analysis of LoRA-based\nfine-tuning across 10 base models and 31 tasks, totaling 310 LLMs fine-tuned with LoRA.\nWe deliberately maintain that all LLMs are fine-tuned with the same training parameters\nand emphasize querying with zero or single-shot, completion-style prompts, with simple\ninstructions like \"Solve the following multiple choice problem\" . Altogether, this provides a\nstandardized framework to compare and assess the intrinsic capabilities of different base\nmodels when fine-tuned with LoRA under consistent conditions, across specific tasks.\nWe also aim to explore the viability of serving multiple LoRA models in a real-world\nproduction application. LoRAX [ 1] enables serving multiple LoRA models simultaneously\non a single GPU by leveraging shared base model weights and dynamic adapter loading [12].\nWe measure latency and concurrency metrics of this library. We use LoRAX to deploy 25\nfine-tuned LLM served on a single A1002in the LoRA Land web application. Our successful\nimplementation showcases the economic efficiency of serving multiple LoRA-adapted LLMs\nfor specialized tasks.\nFinally, we release all 25 of the fine-tuned models on the LoRA Land web application and\ntheir training recipes on (Hugging Face) to allow further analysis and replication by the\ncommunity.\n2 Related work\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are designed to reduce the high\nexpense of fine-tuning large-scale models. They achieve this by training a relatively small sub-\nset of parameters, compared to the total number of parameters, for adapting to downstream\ntasks. Existing PEFT strategies can be divided into two categories: Prompt-based methods\nadd extra soft tokens (prompts) to the initial input and focus solely on fine-tuning these\ntrainable vectors [ 19,31,42].Adapter-based methods introduce additional trainable modules\ninto the original frozen backbone [ 12,32,30,33]. LoRA [ 14] expands upon adapter-based\n1https://github.com/openai/simple-evals\n2https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/\n2\nfine-tuning by adding a small number of trainable low-rank matrices alongside layers of\nfrozen weights, which introduces a negligible inference overhead. Variants of LoRA include\nworks like [ 22], which employs SVD decomposition to prune less significant singular values for\nmore efficient updates. Another variation, DoRA [ 21], decomposes pre-trained weights into\nmagnitude and direction components while applying LoRA the latter. QLoRA [ 8] optimizes\nLoRA\u2019s design one step further, using 4-bit NF4 weights, double quantization to reduce the\nmemory footprint, and paged optimizers to alleviate memory spikes. In our experiments, we\nfocus on the original implementation of LoRA with 4-bit quantization.\nEfficient serving of LoRA models. The main challenges for serving multiple fine-tuned\nmodels efficiently are:\n1.Scalability: As the demand for model inference grows, the system must scale\nefficiently to handle the increased load. This involves not just scaling up the\ncomputational resources but also managing the load distribution among models to\nmaintain performance.\n2.Cost:The computational resources required to serve multiple fine-tuned models\ncan lead to significant costs. Efficiently managing these costs while maintaining high\nperformance and availability is a major challenge.\nTechniques like Segmented Gather Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SGMV) [ 4] aim to address\nthese challenges by optimizing the way computations are performed and resources are used.\nOpen source tools like DeepSpeed3, FasterTransformer4, and vLLM [ 18] also aim to enable\ncost-effective and scalable serving of fine-tuned models. In this paper, we use LoRAX5,\nwhich is specifically designed for the efficient serving of LLMs fine-tuned with LoRA. LoRAX\nsupports dynamic adapter loading so adapters can be downloaded asynchronously during\ninference, multiple model families like Llama [ 37] and Mistral [ 15], and bitsandbytes6-\nquantized models.\n3 Methodology\n3.1 Task selection\nIn selecting datasets and tasks for our study, we prioritize those that are widely accessible\nvia Kaggle7and HuggingFace8and those that are commonly used for benchmarking such as\nthose on the Open LLM Leaderboard [2].\nOur selection includes datasets like MMLU [ 11] for broad domain knowledge, Jigsaw [ 6] for\ncontent moderation, WikiSQL [ 46] for SQL", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 8642, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6237f65a-c154-48ea-b816-ae4c1062c8b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "6237f65a-c154-48ea-b816-ae4c1062c8b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "txt/2405.00732v1.txt", "file_name": "2405.00732v1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79531, "creation_date": "05/2024", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17", "prev_section_summary": "The section discusses the application of Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Large Language Models (LLMs).

To maintain using the same prompts\nwhen comparing models and to ensure the highest likelihood of success amongst all types\nof models (fine-tuned, auto-complete, or instruction-tuned), all of our prompts adhere to\ncompletion style.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the potential of leveraging prompt engineering techniques,\nsuch as the use of majority voting [48], the inclusion of multiple in-context examples\n(n-shot) [ 34], MedPrompt [ 25], chain-of-thought prompting [ 43], etc., to enhance model\nperformance on specific tasks.\nIn our evaluations, we consciously choose notto employ additional prompt engineering or\ntuning strategies for any specific dataset, task, or model. Although using more in-context\nexamples or a more selective approach in n-shot prompting might yield better results, we\nprioritize reproducibility and the minimization of biases that could arise from customized\nin-context learning. Instead, we opt to use simple zero or single-shot completion-style\nprompts for all tasks. Our prompts are written in the completion style, described in Figure\n3, to provide a fair comparison across fine-tuned, instruction-tuned, and auto-complete\nmodels. For classification tasks, the prompt includes all possible classes to inform the\nmodel\u2019s responses. For more specialized tasks, where describing the expected output format\nis challenging, we use a single in-context example \u2013 the first example from the published\ntraining split \u2013 to guide the model.\nFinally, we follow prescribed prompt tagging conventions for each model, as outlined\nin the respective model\u2019s documentation on HuggingFace, to ensure proper querying of\npre-trained and instruction-tuned base models. This includes using \"<s>[INST] ...\n[/INST]\" for prompts intended for Mistral Instruct, and \"<bos><start_of_turn>user\n... <end_of_turn><start_of_turn><model>\" for Gemma\u2019s instruction-tuned mod-\nels.

We use GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613) and GPT-3.5-Turbo\n(gpt-3.5-turbo-0125) as two strong LLM baselines. Our selection of these ten base models\nwas guided by several key considerations, including their widespread adoption within the AI\ncommunity, availability with permissive licenses, and availability of technical reports. We\nspecifically choose base models with \u22648billion parameters to ensure that each model can\nbe efficiently trained within the resource limits of a single A10G GPU.\n3.4 Training parameters\nEach model is trained with published train splits9. Each model is trained for 40000training\nsteps with batch size 1, 4-bit quantization using bitsandbytes and a LoRA rank of 8.

Gradients are applied over 16accumulation\nsteps for an effective batch size of 16.\nThese training parameters, combined with gradient checkpointing, allow each LLM to be\nfine-tuned on a single A10 GPU with 24 GB of memory.

Figure 4 shows an\nexample of a config.\n3.5 Evaluation\nAs specified in Table 2, models are evaluated on the test split if it exists and is labeled, or the\nvalidation set otherwise10. We employ a tailored set of evaluation metrics to accurately assess\nthe performance across all of the tasks. We use accuracy for classification tasks, (1 - mean\nabsolute error) for regression tasks11, and rouge-L12for generation tasks. The WikiSQL\ndataset has its own evaluation suite, however due to challenges integrating the WikiSQL\nevaluation suite, we have adopted the ROUGE metric as a proxy for assessing query quality13.\nFor coding, we use HumanEval [ 5]. For GSM8K [ 7], a regex-based heuristic [ 9] is used to\nextract the mathematical answer to be consistent with the Open LLM Leaderboard [ 2]. All\nmetrics are on a 0 to 1 scale, where 0 is the worst possible score, and 1 the best possible\nscore.\nNon-fine-tuned models often generate more varied outputs, including unintended artifacts\nsuch as additional words or explanations not specified in the prompt. For classification tasks,\nsometimes these models will generate the actual class string like \"Yes/No\", \"positive/negative\"\nor \"True/False\" spelled out, instead of the true \"1/0\" label in the dataset even when instructed.\nTo minimize metric deductions due to response parsing strictness, we first use a regex-based\nextraction step to map the model\u2019s response to the ground truth vocabulary. If there are\nmultiple matches in the generated text, the first valid match is used. The code for regex-based\npre-metric response extractions are available at github.com/predibase/lora-bakeoff.\nFinancial constraints associated with LLM APIs are not trivial. For example, using GPT-4\nto assess the complete WikiSQL test set of 15,878 examples would cost approximately $400,\n10MMLU has a published test set with labels, however, we use validation split to be consistent\nwith the HELM benchmark [20]\n11Mean absolute error (MAE) is used because the range of target values are integer-like and small.\n12Text generation tasks are complicated to evaluate automatically [ 16]. ROUGE-L is a widely\nadopted proxy metric that focuses on the longest common subsequence between the generated text\nand the reference text, which captures the semantic similarity between the generated and reference\ntexts rather than relying solely on exact word matches. ROUGE-L may not fully capture aspects\nlike fluency, coherence and should be used in conjunction with other metrics and human evaluations\nto provide a fuller assessment of text generation quality.\n13Although ROUGE is not tailored for SQL queries, it offers a viable alternative for gauging the\nalignment between generated and target queries.\n7\nFigure 4: Example LLM model training configuration for LoRA-based fine-tuning. Based on\nLudwig [24].\nconsidering the average input (805) and output (16) token counts per example. Such costs\ncan be prohibitive, especially for organizations or researchers operating on limited budgets.\nTo manage costs while maintaining rigor, we restrict evaluations to the first1000 examples\nfor datasets with evaluation splits larger than 1000 examples. We acknowledge that this\nmethod may introduce selection bias and affect the generalizability of our findings. We\nrecommend that future research considers more expansive evaluations as resources permit.\n4 Results\nLoRA fine-tuning provides a consistent and significant boost from fine-tuning across base\nmodels and tasks, as seen in Figure 5. Before fine-tuning, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 have the\nstrongest performance out of the box compared to all other base models, with 0.599 and\n0.661 overall scores, respectively. Performance boosts from fine-tuning range from +26.3 to\n+51.2 points of improvement depending on the base model, and +38.7 on average (Table 3).\nDepending on the task, the best fine-tuned LLM outperforms the best base model from +8.3\nto +67.5 points, +25.0 points on average (Table 4).\n8\nTasksPerformance lift (absolute points)\n-0.50-0.250.000.250.500.75\nmagicodermmlu\nglue_wnli\narc_combinedwikisqlboolq\ncustomer_supportglue_colawinograndeglue_sst2dbpediahellaswagglue_qnlie2e_nlgglue_qqpbc5cdr\nglue_mnliwebnlg\ntldr_content_genglue_mrpcjigsaw\nhellaswag_processedviggo\nglue_stsbgsm8k conllpp\ntldr_headline_gendrop legalreuterscovidOver GPT-4 Over best base model (<= 7B)Figure 5: Performance lift from the best fine-tuned LLM over 1) the best base model (<=\n7B) (in blue) and GPT-4 (in red) across 31 tasks, in absolute points.\nAfter fine-tuning, 301/310 models surpass their base model counterpart14, while 224/310\nfine-tuned LLMs surpass the benchmark set by GPT-4 (Table 4). Gemma-2b is the worst\nperforming base model after fine-tuning, but also experiences the largest lift from fine-tuning\noverall, which suggests that models with lower initial scores stand to benefit the most from\nfine-tuning (Figure 1).\nBy overall average across all tasks, all fine-tuned models perform better than GPT-3.5, and\nall 7B fine-tuned models perform better than GPT-4, except for gemma-7b and gemma-7b-it.\nPhi-2, with as few as 2 billion parameters, exhibits performance competitive with GPT-4\nafter fine-tuning, consistent with the findings of the Phi-2 technical report [46].\nAveraged over 31 tasks, the overall performance of the best fine-tuned LLMs (0.756) are\nsignificantly higher than GPT-4 (0.661) (Table 4). A detailed breakdown of performance per\nmodel, per task, can be found in Appendix C.\n5 Discussion and Analysis\n5.1 Which Base Model is the best for LoRA Fine-tuning?\nMistral-7B and Zephyr-7b-beta emerge as leaders, albeit in different categories. Mistral-7B\nfrequently achieves top performance across the most number of tasks (10/31), suggesting\na high adaptability (Figure 6). Conversely, Zephyr boasts the highest overall average\nperformance (0.731). Mistral-7b, Mistral-7b-instruct, and Zephyr-7b-beta (which is itself\nbased on Mistral-7b-instruct [ 38]) lead the pack for LoRA fine-tuning performance, ahead of\nLlama, Phi, and Gemma families.\n14Most instances where fine-tuning was worse than the base model were in the family of Gemma\nmodels. This is possibly due to the bugs with the Gemma family of models as identified by\nUnsloth[10], which were not accounted for when benchmarks were collected.\n9\nTask Metric Best BM Best FT GPT-4 Lift over BM Lift over GPT-4\nmagicoder humaneval 0.201 0.433 0.829 0.232 -0.396\nmmlu accuracy 0.506 0.589 0.774 0.083 -0.185\nglue_wnli accuracy 0.437 0.873 0.93 0.436 -0.057\narc_combined accuracy 0.673 0.915 0.947 0.242 -0.032\nwikisql rouge 0.301 0.898 0.909 0.597 -0.011\nboolq accuracy 0.764 0.909 0.911 0.145 -0.002\ncustomer_support accuracy 0.850 1.000 1.000 0.150 0.000\nglue_cola accuracy 0.797 0.872 0.864 0.075 0.008\nwinogrande accuracy 0.576 0.84 0.832 0.264 0.008\nglue_sst2 accuracy", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 7619, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23209321-56cf-472f-a9f8-acf6a5549091": {"__data__": {"id_": "23209321-56cf-472f-a9f8-acf6a5549091", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "txt/2405.00732v1.txt", "file_name": "2405.00732v1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79531, "creation_date": "05/2024", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17", "prev_section_summary": "The section discusses the use of LoRA-based fine-tuning experiments on various large language models (LLMs) to enhance their performance across different tasks.

Identifying such a relationship could provide a valuable\npredictive tool for assessing the potential benefits of fine-tuning enhancements on new tasks\nbefore the fine-tuning process begins.\n5.5.1 Heuristics for fine-tuning quality, quality lift, and task complexity\nTo quantify task complexity, we use several heuristics:\n\u2022Number of training examples\n\u2022Lengths of inputs and outputs ( \u00b5,\u03c3, and 95th percentile).\n\u2022Compressibility15(\u00b5and\u03c3)\n\u2022Diversity of content, which we approximate by measuring the rouge-L similarity\nbetween inputs and outputs) [41] ( \u00b5and\u03c3).\nFor task complexity heuristic,\nFor model quality measurements, we track:\n\u2022Baseline GPT-4 score\n\u2022Lift from the best fine-tuned model vs. GPT-4 (\"Max GPT-4 Lift\")\n\u2022Average fine-tuning lift over the base model\n\u2022Best base model score without fine-tuning\n\u2022Average base model score without fine-tuning\n\u2022Best fine-tuned model score\n\u2022Average fine-tuned model score\nRefer to Table 5 for a complete example.\n5.5.2 Correlating fine-tuning quality and quality lift with task complexity\nWe find several intriguing correlations suggesting significant interactions between our task\ncomplexity heuristics and measurements of model performance. Key observations include:\n\u2022Compressibility exhibited a dual influence, correlating positively with both best\nand average base model scores (0.36), while correlating negatively with these scores\nwhen the variance in compressibility increased (-0.37). This indicates that while\nuniform compressibility supports model performance, higher variability in compress-\nibility tends to degrade it.\n\u2022Input and Output Lengths: Longer and more varied output lengths correlated\npositively with the maximum lift from GPT-4 fine-tuning, suggesting that tasks with\nextended and more varied outputs are not detrimental for fine-tuning. Conversely,\nlonger and more varied input and output lengths negatively correlate with absolute\nbase and fine-tuned model scores.\n15https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html\n12\nMetric arc_combined bc5cdr boolq\nModel quality measurementsMax GPT-4 Lift -0.03 0.08 0.00\nAverage Base Model Lift 0.32 0.75 0.19\nBest Base Model Score 0.67 0.70 0.76\nAverage Base Model Score 0.41 0.22 0.64\nBest Fine-tuned Score 0.92 0.97 0.91\nAverage Fine-Tuned Score 0.73 0.97 0.82\nTask complexity heuristicsInput length p95 143.00 175.00 270.70\nInput length \u00b5 102.89 142.15 145.23\nInput length \u03c3 21.68 19.17 69.03\nOutput length p95 1.00 58.00 1.00\nOutput length \u00b5 1.00 37.11 1.00\nOutput length \u03c3 0.00 11.27 0.00\nExample length \u00b5 102.92 178.26 146.23\nExample length p95 143.00 226.05 271.70\nExample length \u03c3 21.66 27.84 69.03\nI/O rougeL similarity \u00b5 0.03 0.19 0.00\nI/O rougeL similarity \u03c3 0.01 0.03 0.00\nCompressibility \u00b5 0.64 0.55 0.60\nCompressibility \u03c3 0.06 0.01 0.07\n# training examples 3370 5228 9427\nTable 5: Model quality measurements and task complexity heuristics for 3 different tasks\n(example).

Results are summarized in Table 6, where we find that linear models yield root\nmean squared errors (RMSE) of 0.166 to 0.092, depending on the model quality metric in\nquestion.\nIncorporating the score of the average base model without fine tuning as an additional\nfeature improves prediction accuracy for all model quality metrics (+0.004 to +0.069). This\ndemonstrates some predictive power in knowing base model performance for anticipating\npotential gains from fine-tuning. RMSE errors are rather low, suggesting that upfront\nheuristics-based measurements of dataset complexity can be reasonable indicators of positive\nfine-tuning impact.\n13\nFigure 8: Correlations between dataset complexity and model quality correlations for 310\nLLMs across 31 tasks, before and after LoRA-based fine-tuning.\nModel Quality MetricWith average base model score\nas a feature\n(RMSE)With average base model score\nas a feature\n(RMSE)\nGPT-4 Score 0.140 0.121\nMax GPT-4 Lift 0.092 0.085\nAverage Base Model Score 0.099 N/A (0.000)\nBest Base Model Score 0.166 0.097\nAverage Base Model Lift 0.099 0.095\nAverage Fine-Tuned Score 0.119 0.095\nBest Fine-tuned Score 0.097 0.091\nTable 6: The performance of linear regression models predicting model quality heuristics\nbefore and after fine-tuning, given z-score normalized dataset complexity heuristics, with\nand without a representative base model score.\n6 Performance Benchmarks of LoRAX Deployments\nTo assess the viability of serving many LoRA fine-tuned LLMs simultaneously in a real-world\napplication, we launch LoRA Land.

This may introduce selection bias and limit the generalizability of our findings.\nFuture research should consider more comprehensive evaluations as resources allow.\n\u2022Prompt Engineering Constraints: Our study does not employ advanced prompt\nengineering techniques such as majority voting, n-shot prompting, or specialized\ntuning methods like MedPrompt or chain-of-thought prompting. In this study, we\nprioritize reproducibility and minimize biases from selective example choice by using\nsimple zero or single-shot prompts across all tasks, however these techniques have\nshown potential in enhancing task-specific performance.\n\u2022Training Constraints: All LLMs are fine-tuned with the same Models are trained\nwith consistent parameters: 40K examples, batch size of 1, 4-bit quantization, and\na LoRA rank of 8, using an adam optimizer and a cosine learning rate scheduler\nwith specific settings. Training is conducted on a single A10 GPU, using gradient\ncheckpointing to manage memory limitations. For datasets where full sequence\nlengths induce memory overflow, we truncate sequences to the 95th percentile length.\nThis approach may impact the thoroughness of model training, particularly on\ndatasets where 40K steps do not complete even one full epoch. Expanding hardware\ncapabilities, increasing batch sizes, or adjusting hyperparameters like the learning\nrate or scheduler could potentially enhance outcomes.\n\u2022Limited Model Variety: Our experiments are limited to LoRA fine-tuning on\ntwo model sizes, 2B and 7B. Exploring a broader range of model sizes, including\nlarger models such as 13B or 70B, could provide insights into the scalability and\neffectiveness of fine-tuning across different computational capacities.\nWe maintain that LoRA Land successfully demonstrates the practical efficiency of training\nand serving several task-specialized LLMs that rival GPT-4 in a production application\npowered by LoRAX, despite these limitations.\n8 Conclusion\nIn this study, we assess the efficacy of Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) across a broad range of tasks and models and the viability of\nserving multiple fine-tuned LoRA LLMs in production.\nOn model quality, our results confirm that LoRA fine-tuning significantly enhances LLM\nperformance, surpassing non-fine-tuned bases and GPT-4. The standout performance of\nmodels like Mistral-7B across multiple tasks highlights the importance of base model selection\nin fine-tuning success. We find that dataset complexity heuristics can be reasonably leveraged\nas potential predictors of fine-tuning success, suggesting that the nature of the task plays an\nimportant role in the effectiveness of fine-tuning.\n18\nDespite these outcomes, limitations such as the scale of evaluations, training constraints, and\nthe simplicity of our prompt engineering approaches suggest areas for future improvement.\nWe release all of our models and training setups for further community validation and\nexperimentation.\nOn serving, we demonstrate the practical deployment of these models using the LoRAX\nframework through the LoRA Land web application. We provide benchmarks for time to\nfirst token (TFTT), total request time, and token streaming time, and measure LoRAX\u2019s\nlatency robustness to up to 100 concurrent users.\nAltogether, LoRA Land emphasizes the quality and cost-effectiveness of employing multiple\nspecialized LLMs over a single, general-purpose LLM.\n9 Acknowledgements\nJustin Zhao led the research and wrote the paper.

In this paper, we demonstrate how Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) can effectively learn to use an off-the-shelf information\nretrieval (IR) system specifically when additional context is required\nto answer a given question. Given the performance of IR systems, the\noptimal strategy for question answering does not always entail exter-\nnal information retrieval; rather, it often involves leveraging the para-\nmetric memory of the LLM itself. Prior research has identified this\nphenomenon in the PopQA dataset, wherein the most popular ques-\ntions are effectively addressed using the LLM\u2019s parametric memory,\nwhile less popular ones require IR system usage. Following this, we\npropose a tailored training approach for LLMs, leveraging existing\nopen-domain question answering datasets. Here, LLMs are trained\nto generate a special token, \u27e8RET\u27e9, when they do not know the an-\nswer to a question. Our evaluation of the Adaptive Retrieval LLM\n(ADAPT -LLM) on the PopQA dataset showcases improvements over\nthe same LLM under three configurations: (i) retrieving information\nfor all the questions, (ii) using always the parametric memory of the\nLLM, and (iii) using a popularity threshold to decide when to use a\nretriever. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that A DAPT -LLM is\nable to generate the \u27e8RET\u27e9token when it determines that it does not\nknow how to answer a question, indicating the need for IR, while it\nachieves notably high accuracy levels when it chooses to rely only\non its parametric memory.\n1 Introduction\nThe task of question answering (QA) remains a focal point in Natural\nLanguage Understanding research. There are many different datasets\nserving as benchmarks for evaluating QA models, such as Natural\nQuestions (NQ) [18], SQuAD [25] or QuAC [7], just to mention a\nfew. Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) consistently out-\nperform traditional methods on these benchmarks, showcasing re-\nmarkable performance.\nTypically, there are two primary approaches to utilize LLMs for\nquestion answering:\n(i)Closed Book Question Answering : This approach involves\nstrategies like instruction tuning [32] or few-shot prompting [6] to\nenhance performance. Here, the LLM relies solely on its parametric\n\u2217Corresponding Author. Email: tlabruna@fbk.eu.memory to answer questions. However, these parametric memories\nhave inherent limitations as they are based entirely on the training\ncorpus, meaning for example that they could be outdated regarding\nevents occurring after the training process.\n(ii)Open Book Question Answering : In this approach, the LLM\nis coupled with an Information Retriever (IR) system [13, 36]. By\nleveraging the IR system, the LLM can retrieve relevant context to\nsupplement its understanding and provide more accurate answers.\nHowever, the research conducted by Mallen, Alex Troy and Asai,\nAkari and Zhong, Victor and Das, Rajarshi and Khashabi, Daniel and\nHajishirzi, Hannaneh [22] sheds light on the complexity of question-\nanswering strategies, challenging the notion that the optimal ap-\nproach always involves the utilization of an IR system. Through the\nintroduction of the PopQA dataset, comprising 14 thousand ques-\ntions annotated with popularity scores, they demonstrated that while\nLLMs relying solely on their parametric memories excel in ad-\ndressing high-popularity questions, the efficacy diminishes for low-\npopularity questions, where using IR becomes curcial.\nTheir findings underscore the importance of a hybrid approach,\nwhere LLMs utilize parametric memory for high-popularity ques-\ntions, but use an off-the-shelf IR system to retrieve relevant context\nto answer low-popularity questions. Central to their methodology is\nthe establishment of a fixed popularity score threshold, which they\nuse to decide whether an IR system has to be employed.\nIn many cases, however, question answering datasets do not in-\nclude popularity scores, so relying on such scores is not a general-\nizable approach. Motivated by this limitation, our study aims to ad-\ndress whether LLMs can autonomously determine when to employ\nan IR system for improved question answering. To investigate this,\nwe conduct an evaluation of an LLM using an open-domain question\nanswering dataset to identify the questions for which the LLM pro-\nvides accurate responses and those where its answers are incorrect.\nSpecifically, for questions where the LLM\u2019s response is incorrect,\nwe annotate them with a special token, \u27e8RET\u27e9, indicating the need\nfor additional context. Subsequently, we utilize these annotations to\nconstruct a new dataset tailored for training purposes, where we teach\nan LLM to answer directly if it is confident about the answer or to\nrequire context it believes is useful for answering the question (see\nFigure 1). Our hypothesis is that through this training process, the\nLLM learns to use an IR system when it needs extra context to answerarXiv:2404.19705v2  [cs.CL]  6 May 2024\nLLM\n1 1Question\nIf not RETIf RET\nAnswerIR\n LLM\nAnswerContext\n1 2\n1 31 4\n1 5Figure 1 : The inference process of A DAPT -LLM step-by-step: given a question (step 1), an LLM decides (step 2) whether to answer the\nquestion directly (step 3) or to ask for additional contextual information, generating the special \u27e8RET\u27e9token; for the later, an off-the-shelf IR\nsystem is used to retrieve relevant context (step 4), which is used alongside the question to prompt again the LLM for the final answer (step 5).\na question, thus we name it A DAPT -LLM.\nTo validate our hypothesis, we conducted several experiments on\nthe PopQA dataset [22], as it provides a suitable platform for bench-\nmarking hybrid retrieval strategies. As a result of these experiments\nwe find that:\n\u2022ADAPT -LLM consistently outperforms typical fixed strategies for\nquestion answering, such as (i) using the IR system for all ques-\ntions and (ii) relying solely on the parametric memory of the LLM.\n\u2022ADAPT -LLM demonstrates performance comparable to strategies\nthat rely on popularity scores to determine when to use an IR sys-\ntem, even without utilizing any popularity score or similar metric.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that popularity scores are a unique feature of the\nPopQA dataset, rendering them inapplicable to other open-domain\nquestion answering datasets.\n\u2022When A DAPT -LLM decides to retrieve additional information,\nthe results obtained with the context are significantly better than\nthose without it. Similarly, when A DAPT -LLM directly answers\nquestions relying on its parametric memory, it achieves high ac-\ncuracies. These observations indicate that the model effectively\ndiscerns when to retrieve information and when it can answer a\nquestion without further context.\n\u2022The primary bottleneck for the performance of A DAPT -LLM lies\nin the IR system. A DAPT -LLM achieves much higher perfor-\nmance with gold passages compared to passages retrieved by the\nIR system.\nOur findings underscore the significance of adaptive retrieval\nstrategies in enhancing the performance of LLMs for question an-\nswering tasks. By training A DAPT -LLM to dynamically determine\nwhen to retrieve additional context, we demonstrate the feasibility\nof teaching an LLM how to effectively leverage external information\nsources only when necessary.\n2 Related Work\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [19] has shown improve-\nments on a wide variety of NLP areas, such as question answer-\ning [17, 13, 31, 23], truthfulness [14, 21] and language modelling[12, 5, 26] among others. The ability to ground model generations\non retrieved text chunks has also enabled smaller models to match\nthe performance of larger ones [2]. Moreover, due to the extremely\nhigh cost of training LLMs, RAG has become the standard way to\nmaintain them updated with new information, not having to re-train\nthe models periodically to incorporate new facts [10].\nEven if augmenting LLMs with retrieval is an essential step for the\ncurrent generation of LLMs [15, 27] it also comes with a cost.

In order to try to solve this issue, many pre-trained Transformer\nencoder based dense models have been proposed [9, 28, 17, 11].\nTrained neural models have shown good performance over a variety\nof retrieval benchmarks but they still struggle in the zero-shot setup\nfor new domains [33]. The quality of the retrieval engine is essential\nfor retrieval-augmented models as this will set the upper bound of\nthe model performance. Moreover, the usage of a retrieval engine,\nespecially when the target document index is huge, can significantly\nincrease the latency of the model and hurt real time applications user\nexperience [3].\nOn the other hand, as models keep scaling, the world knowledge\nencoded in their parameters does too [16]. Many previous efforts\nhave shown that language models are able to memorize a significant\namount of world knowledge and achieve competitive performance\non tasks such as open-domain question answering when they just use\ntheir parametric knowledge for solving the task [20, 1, 34, 35].\nMotivated by all this, the adaptive approach has been proposed\nas a new solution [30, 22]. In this approach, if the solution to the\ntask is encoded in the parameters of the model, the model will be\ndirectly used for generating a solution. Conversely, if the answer is\nnot encoded in the knowledge of the model, the answer generation\nwill be augmented with external knowledge.\nRecently, Schick et al. [30] proposed the Toolformer, a model that\ncan self teach how and when to use external tools via simple API\ncalls including a calculator, search engines, a calendar and so on.\nThe self learning process is based on a synthetic text only corpus\nthat is enriched by prompting an LLM. The LLM first adds inline\nAPI calls on top of the unsupervised corpus. These API calls are\nthen validated by evaluating whether the execution of the API calls\nis helpful for predicting the future tokens. This unsupervised method\nsignificantly boosts model performance in a variety of tasks when\ncompared against non augmented LLMs, but it also makes the model\nover use tools. As an example, for the QA task the model uses the\nsearch engine 99.3% of the cases. On our work, we try to take ad-\nvantage of the parametric knowledge of LLMs and just perform re-\ntrieval when needed. A DAPT -LLM decreases the usage of IR down\nto 83.99% while improving performance over vanilla retrieval.\nMore similar to our work, Mallen, Alex Troy and Asai, Akari\nand Zhong, Victor and Das, Rajarshi and Khashabi, Daniel and Ha-\njishirzi, Hannaneh [22] propose a dataset and method for measuring\nwhen non-parametric information needs to be retrieved. They present\nthe PopQA dataset that contains 14K questions about a set of enti-\nties with varying popularity. The popularity of an entity is measured\nby the page views of its Wikipedia page. In order to solve this QA\ntask, they use a popularity score threshold calculated on the PopQA\ndataset. If the popularity score of an individual entity is below the\nthreshold they perform a retrieval step. On the contrary, if the score\nis greater than the threshold they directly answer the question. This\nmethod yields better results than vanilla retrieval but it requires the\ncalculation of a popularity score that is not available in realistic QA\nscenarios.\nAnother relevant contribution in this field, contemporaneous with\nour research, is the work by Erbacher et al. [8], where they trained\nan LLM to determine when to utilize external knowledge. They par-\nticularly focused on finding the optimal trade-off between the risk\nof hallucination and the cost of information retrieval, given the po-\ntentially high expense associated with IR. Our A DAPT -LLM method\nadopts a similar approach, training an LLM to learn when to retrieve\ninformation. However, we extend this by comparing our method\u2019s\nperformance against some baselines, and assess the effectiveness of\nretrieving information in an adaptive manner against the strategies of\nnever retrieving or always retrieving.1\n3 Adaptive Retrieval LLM (A DAPT -LLM)\nAdaptive retrieval refers to the model\u2019s capability to dynamically de-\ntermine whether to retrieve additional context information for gener-\nating answers in question answering tasks. Unlike traditional models\nthat either always incorporate context or never consider it, adaptive\nretrieval allows the model to selectively retrieve context based on the\nspecific requirements of each question. This adaptive approach aims\nto optimize performance by leveraging context only when necessary,\nthereby enhancing the model\u2019s ability to generate accurate answers.\nAs depicted in Figure 1, the process of the A DAPT -LLM unfolds\nin the following sequence:\n1. The first prompt containing the question is sent to the model (step\n1 of Figure 1).\n2. The A DAPT -LLM evaluates the prompt to determine whether ad-\nditional context is necessary to answer the question effectively\n(step 2).\n3. If the model determines that context is not required, it directly\nproduces a response to the question by leveraging its parametric\nmemory (step 3).\n4. If context is deemed necessary, the A DAPT -LLM model returns\na special token, represented as \u27e8RET\u27e9, and an off-the-shelf IR\nsystem is used to retrieve pertinent context based on the question\n1All resources are publicly available at https://github.com/tLabruna/Adapt-\nLLM.Algorithm 1: Training data creation\nInput: Q: questions, A: answers, P: passages, LLM\nOutput: DSAdapt : A training dataset for Adaptive Retrieval\n1DSAdapt = init_empty()\n2forq, gold_ans, pass in (Q, A, P) do\n3 ans = LLM(q)\n4 ifans = gold_ans then\n5 inst = build_instance(\u2019parametric_prompt\u2019, q,\ngold_ans)\n6 DSAdapt .add(inst)\n7 end\n8 else\n9 inst1 = build_instance(\u2019parametric_prompt\u2019, q,\n\"<RET>\")\n10 DSAdapt .add(inst1)\n11 inst2 = build_instance(\u2019context_prompt\u2019, q, gold_ans,\npass)\n12 DSAdapt .add(inst2)\n13 end\n14end\n15returnDSAdapt\n(step 4); the context is then combined with the original question\nprompt to form a comprehensive representation for answer gener-\nation (step 5).\nThe decision-making process of A DAPT -LLM enables the model\nto determine the necessity of context for answering questions through\ndynamic assessment of each prompt. This flexible behavior allows\nthe model to strike a balance between utilizing context for enhanced\nunderstanding and delivering direct answers when sufficient.\n3.1 Training ADAPT -LLM\nHere, we delineate the methodology employed to train our A DAPT -\nLLM model. The process of crafting the training data, denoted as\nDSAdapt , is presented in Algorithm 1.\nWe begin by selecting an open-domain question answering dataset\ncontaining questions Q, associated context passages P, and corre-\nsponding answers A. We initialize DSAdapt to an empty set (line 1\nof the algorithm). For each question in Q, we leverage the base LLM\nwithout any retrieval mechanism to perform a zero-shot inference\n(line 3). This step allows us to differentiate questions for which the\nmodel generates correct answers from those where its responses are\ninaccurate. This process can be understood as a way to discover what\nthe base LLM knows due to its parametric memory. For questions\nwhere the model\u2019s response is accurate (line 4), we build a training\nset instance incorporating the following prompt, which we call para-\nmetric_prompt :\nPrompt: Answer the question Q. If you need\nhelp answer <RET> to get the context. Q:\n{...}\nAlongside this prompt, we include the corresponding question\nfromQand the golden answer from A, collectively forming the\ninstance (line 5), which is subsequently appended to the DSAdapt\ndataset (line 6).\nIn contrast, if the LLM fails to produce a correct response to the\nquestion (line 8), we build two different instances.

Q: {...}, C: {...}\nFor this instance, we include the prompt, the question from Q, the\ngolden answer from A, and the corresponding context passage from\nP(line 11).\nAfter populating the dataset with both types of prompts for ques-\ntions where the LLM could not respond accurately and only the para-\nmetric_prompt with golden answers for all other questions, our train-\ning set DAdapt is prepared for the subsequent fine-tuning phase. The\nfine-tuning process entails training the base LLM on our dataset, re-\nsulting in the A DAPT -LLM model.\nThis approach ensures that the model effectively learns to discern\nwhen context is necessary for answering questions, or to provide a\ndirect response when it suffices, as well as answer directly when pro-\nvided with context.\n3.2 Inference\nIn the inference phase, we utilize the fine-tuned model to generate\nresponses to unseen questions. We employ the same prompts used\nduring the training phase, as outlined in Section 3.1.\nInitially, the model is prompted to either provide a direct response\nor return \u27e8RET\u27e9if it is unsure of the answer. If the model returns\n\u27e8RET\u27e9, we proceed with information retrieval to acquire relevant\ncontext by means of an off-the-shelf IR system. Subsequently, we\naugment the question with the retrieved context and prompt the\nmodel again using the second type of prompt introduced during the\ntraining phase.\n4 Experiments and Results\nIn this section, we outline the experimental framework aimed at as-\nsessing the performance of the proposed adaptive retrieval approach,\nADAPT -LLM. We begin by describing the datasets utilized (Sec-\ntion 4.1), followed by an overview of our base model (Section 4.2),\nthe different configurations of the base model (Section 4.3), and the\ntraining details (Section 4.4). Subsequently, we introduce the three\nprimary experiments:\n1.

Analysis of A DAPT -LLM\u2019s ability to determine when extra con-\ntext is necessary to answer a question (Section 4.6).\n3. Comparison with the state-of-the-art approach for PopQA (Sec-\ntion 4.7).\n4.1 Datasets\nTo ensure comprehensive training and evaluation of our models, we\nspecifically selected three diverse question answering datasets. For\ntraining, we chose NQ [18] and SQuAD [25], as they are widely\nrecognized datasets that assess factual knowledge and are based on\nWikipedia. For evaluation, we opted for PopQA [22]. Below are brief\ndescriptions of each dataset:\nNQ The Natural Questions dataset [18] is a collection of real-world\nquestions derived from Google search queries, accompanied by long-\nform text passages obtained from Wikipedia articles and providing a\ndiverse range of topics and natural language variations. We utilize\nthis dataset for training our models in the experiments.\nSQuAD The Stanford Question Answering Dataset SQuAD [25]\nis a widely utilized dataset in the field of natural language processing\nand comprises questions posed by crowdworkers on a diverse range\nof Wikipedia articles, along with relevant paragraph passages serv-\ning as context. We utilize this dataset for training our models in the\nexperiments.\nPopQA The Popular Questions and Answers dataset [22] consists\nof curated questions sourced from various online platforms, encom-\npassing a wide range of domains and styles. Given the variability\nin the effectiveness of context retrieval strategies observed in this\ndataset, we select PopQA as our test set to evaluate the language\nmodels\u2019 performance in determining when context is necessary for\naccurate answer provision.\n4.2 Base Model\nIn our experiments, we employ Llama-2 [34] as our base LLM.\nLlama-2 is an open-source instruction-based LLM, which comes in\nversions of 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters. The model is pretrained\non an expanded corpus sourced from publicly available online data\nsources. This corpus offers a 40% increase in size compared to its\npredecessor, contributing to the model\u2019s enhanced performance and\ncapabilities.\nAdditionally, Llama-2 features an extended context length, ef-\nfectively doubling its capacity to process and comprehend longer\nsequences of text. These enhancements significantly improve the\nmodel\u2019s effectiveness across various natural language understanding\ntasks. Specifically, for our experiments, we utilize the Llama-2 model\nTraining \u27e8RET \u27e9Usage \u27e8RET \u27e9 No\u27e8RET \u27e9\nAcc. w/ context Acc. w/o context Acc. w/ context Acc. w/o context\nNQ 82.26% 33.04% 14.65% 55.72% 62.36%\nSQuAD 83.93% 33.40% 9.94% 57.73% 62.92%\nTable 3 : Results of the usage of the \u27e8RET\u27e9token in the A DAPT -LLM model. The first column shows the percentage of PopQA questions for\nwhich the model requests additional context. The second column focuses on the questions for which A DAPT -LLM asks for context ( \u27e8RET\u27e9),\ncomparing the performance between answering those questions with and without context. The last column (No \u27e8RET\u27e9) is for questions which\nADAPT -LLM decides to answer directly. We also compare the performance with and without the context retrieved by the IR system.\nwith 7B parameters, leveraging its robust capabilities for our specific\nresearch objectives.\n4.3 Model Configurations\nWe conduct the experiments using three different model configura-\ntions, corresponding to the three different ways in which an LLM and\nan IR system can be combined:\n\u2022Adaptive Retrieval (A DAPT -LLM) . The A DAPT -LLM model\ndynamically decides whether to retrieve context based on the\nquestion and its perceived need for contextual information, as ex-\nplained in Section 3.1. As the IR system, we use Contriever [11],\nwhich is an unsupervised model pretrained on a large corpus, fol-\nlowed by fine-tuning on MS MARCO [24]. We only retrieve the\nmost relevant passage according to the IR system to prompt the\nbase LLM for the final answer.\n\u2022Never-Retrieve (NR-LLM) . This model configuration is trained\nto answer questions solely based on the question text without con-\nsidering any contextual information. It serves as the baseline for\nevaluating the performance of question answering models in the\nabsence of context.\n\u2022Always-Retrieve (AR-LLM) . In contrast to the NR-LLM model,\nthis configuration always retrieves context passages to assist in\nanswering questions. It is trained to utilize context consistently\nfor generating answers. To ensure a fair comparison with A DAPT -\nLLM, we also use Contriever [11] as the IR system and only re-\ntrieve the most relevant passage as context.\n4.4 Training Details\nFor all three model configurations (A DAPT -LLM, AR-LLM and NR-\nLLM) and both training sets (SQuAD and NQ), we adhere to the\nparameter configuration established in Alpaca-Lora [32] which in-\ncludes a batch size of 128, three epochs, and a fixed learning rate of\n3e-4.

Training was performed on an NVIDIA A40 GPU, for an av-\nerage training time of approximately 8 hours. We do not perform\nany model selection and we use the last checkpoint after 3 epochs of\ntraining.\n4.5 Validating the Adaptive Retrieval Approach\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of our adaptive approach (A DAPT -\nLLM) in comparison to the NR-LLM and AR-LLM configurations,\nwe conducted fine-tuning of the Llama-2 model on both the NQ and\nSQuAD datasets across all three configurations. For the NR-LLM\nand AR-LLM configurations, we constructed training samples by ex-\ntracting question-answer pairs from the datasets and incorporating\ncorresponding instruction prompts.Specifically, prompts for the NR-LLM configuration instructed\nthe model to answer questions without additional context, whereas\nprompts for the AR-LLM configuration included both the question\nand contextual information. In contrast, the A DAPT -LLM training\nset was constructed following the approach outlined in Section 3.1,\nemploying a two-step process. As a result of this process, the 74.72%\nof the questions in NQ are marked with the \u27e8RET\u27e9token, whereas the\n87.49% questions are marked for SQuAD.\nThe trained models were then tested on the PopQA dataset to eval-\nuate their performance in a real-world question answering scenario.\nDuring inference, the NR-LLM and AR-LLM models were utilized\nas is, with corresponding instruction prompts provided, and outputs\nexpected to be answers to the questions. Conversely, for the A DAPT -\nLLM model, we followed the same prompt procedure as explained\nin Section 3.2.\nThe generated answers are then compared to the set of possi-\nble answers for each question, which are already annotated in the\nPopQA test set. The evaluation metric used is Exact Match Accu-\nracy , which measures the percentage of generated outputs that ex-\nactly match one of the possible answers for the corresponding ques-\ntion.\nTable 1 presents the results of this experiment, illustrating the per-\nformance of the Llama-2 model across the different configurations\nand datasets. Across both the NQ and SQuAD training datasets, the\nADAPT -LLM configuration consistently outperforms the Never Re-\ntrieve (NR-LLM) and Always Retrieve (AR-LLM) configurations on\nthe PopQA test set. As can be observed, NR-LLM exhibits the lowest\nperformance among the models, with an accuracy difference of ap-\nproximately 14 absolute points compared to the other configurations.\nThis disparity suggests that the parametric memory of Llama-2 alone\nis not sufficient for effectively answering PopQA questions.\nThe differences between AR-LLM and A DAPT -LLM are nar-\nrower. Specifically, the A DAPT -LLM configuration achieves an ac-\ncuracy of 36.77% and 38.15% on the PopQA test set when trained\non the NQ and SQuAD datasets, respectively, compared to 35.86%\nand 36.59% for the AR-LLM configuration. Across both training\ndatasets, A DAPT -LLM outperforms AR-LLM, with the largest dif-\nference observed when trained on SQuAD.\nAll in all, these results underscore the efficacy of the adaptive re-\ntrieval approach in dynamically determining the necessity of context\nfor accurate question answering, resulting in improved performance\ncompared to fixed strategies of always or never retrieving context.\nAlthough the disparity between training A DAPT -LLM on NQ or\nSQuAD is relatively minor, we try to determine the suitability of a\ntraining set for a given evaluation set. While both training sets (NQ\nand SQuAD) and the evaluation set (PopQA) are based on Wikipedia,\nsubtle differences may exist.\nTable 2 provides insights into the characteristics of the three\ndatasets involved in our experimental procedure, including the to-\ntal number of questions and the average number of words per ques-\nFigure 2 : Histograms depicting the proportion of questions where A DAPT -LLM trained on NQ (left) and A DAPT -LLM trained on SQuAD\n(right) ask for extra context for different popularity score intervals.\ntion and answer. While NQ appears to be closer to PopQA in terms\nof question and answer lengths, the key factor influencing the bet-\nter results of training A DAPT -LLM on SQuAD may be the number\nof questions in the training dataset ( \u223c87K in SQuAD and \u223c58K in\nNQ). Further analyses are required to elucidate the factors that ren-\nder a training dataset more suitable for a given target dataset (which\nis beyond the scope of our study), but these results suggest that scale\nmay play once again a crucial role.\n4.6 Contextual Retrieval Decision Analysis\nIn this experiment, our objective is to once again evaluate the effec-\ntiveness of the A DAPT -LLM model, this time focusing on its ability\nto accurately determine when additional context is needed. For this\npurpose, we adhere to the following steps:\n1. We conduct inference on the A DAPT -LLM model using the\nPopQA test set, prompting it to either return an answer directly\nor indicate the need for additional context by returning \u27e8RET\u27e9.\n2. In the case of receiving a \u27e8RET\u27e9response from the A DAPT -LLM\nmodel, we proceed with the following steps:\n2.1. We conduct inference on the A DAPT -LLM model, prompting\nit to return an answer given the context obtained from the IR\nsystem.\n2.2. We also conduct inference on the NR-LLM model with the in-\nstruction to provide an answer directly without additional con-\ntext.\n3. If the A DAPT -LLM model decides to answer the question directly\nrelying only on its parametric memory:\n3.1. We conduct inference on the A DAPT -LLM model, prompting\nit to return the answer without providing context.\n3.2. We conduct inference on the AR-LLM model with the instruc-\ntion to provide an answer using the context retrieved by the IR\nsystem.\nTable 3 presents the results of this experiment. The first thing to\nnote is that the A DAPT -LLM model generates the \u27e8RET\u27e9token for\napproximately 82-83% of the questions in the PopQA dataset, withPassagesSQuAD Dev NQ Dev\nAcc.

This observa-\ntion aligns with the low performance of the NR-LLM configuration\ndemonstrated in Table 1.\nHowever, A DAPT -LLM consistently determines when additional\ncontext is required to answer a question accurately. Across both the\nNQ and SQuAD training datasets, A DAPT -LLM exhibits signifi-\ncantly higher accuracy when retrieving context compared to the NR-\nLLM model\u2019s accuracy without context (as indicated in the \u27e8RET\u27e9\ncolumn of Table 3). Specifically, for the NQ dataset, the accuracy\nof the A DAPT -LLM model when requesting context is 33.04%,\nwhereas the accuracy of the NR-LLM model without context re-\ntrieval is notably lower at 14.65%. Similarly, for the SQuAD dataset,\nADAPT -LLM achieves an accuracy of 33.40% with context retrieval,\nwhereas the NR-LLM model\u2019s accuracy without context is substan-\ntially lower at 9.94%.\nFinally, the last column of Table 3 (No \u27e8RET\u27e9) shows the per-\nformance of A DAPT -LLM when answering questions based solely\non its parametric memory. As can be seen, accuracies above 62%\nare obtained when no context is utilized, providing further evidence\nthat A DAPT -LLM effectively discerns between retrieving context\nand providing direct answers to questions. Additionally, we evalu-\nate the performance of these questions when context is added to the\ninput, revealing significant decreases in accuracy of up to 7 absolute\npoints.\nThese findings provide insights into the effectiveness of the\ndecision-making process employed by the A DAPT -LLM model in\ndetermining", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 8514, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4530817-9911-4e69-a530-7add24b473e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4530817-9911-4e69-a530-7add24b473e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "txt/2404.19705v2.txt", "file_name": "2404.19705v2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49931, "creation_date": "04/2024", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17", "prev_section_summary": "The section discusses the evaluation and comparison of three different configurations of the Llama-2 model for question answering: ADAPT-LLM, AR-LLM (Always Retrieve), and NR-LLM (Never Retrieve).

Additionally, we evalu-\nate the performance of these questions when context is added to the\ninput, revealing significant decreases in accuracy of up to 7 absolute\npoints.\nThese findings provide insights into the effectiveness of the\ndecision-making process employed by the A DAPT -LLM model in\ndetermining the necessity of additional context for accurate response\ngeneration and present empirical evidence of the necessity of per-\nforming dynamic context retrieval in improving the accuracy of ques-\ntion answering models.\nHowever, it is notable that the overall performance of the model\nwhen answering questions with retrieved context, as observed in\nTable 3 (approximately 33%), is relatively low. To further explore\nthis observation, we conduct an additional experiment: evaluating\nADAPT -LLM (both versions trained on NQ and SQuAD) on the NQ\nand SQuAD development splits, comparing performance when using\nthe gold passages of the dataset and the context retrieved by our IR\nsystem, Contriever [11]. Unfortunately, PopQA does not provide the\ngold passages, so direct evaluation there was not possible.\nTable 4 presents the results of this experiment. A significant per-\nformance difference is observed between using the gold passage and\nthe top passage retrieved by Contriever for both datasets (approxi-\nmately 67 absolute points for SQuAD and 42 for NQ). This indicates\nthat Contriever, and current IR systems in general, do not consistently\nretrieve the most relevant passage to answer a given question. This\nobservation underscores the importance of retrieving multiple doc-\numents as context, as seen in the most successful open-domain QA\nsystems [13], and highlights its impact on the overall performance of\nADAPT -LLM in PopQA.\nTo further validate the behavior of A DAPT -LLM when requesting\nadditional context, Figure 2 illustrates the proportion of questions\nfor which our model generates the \u27e8RET\u27e9token, aggregated by pop-\nularity score intervals (left image for A DAPT -LLM trained on NQ\nand right image for SQuAD). Mallen, Alex Troy and Asai, Akari\nand Zhong, Victor and Das, Rajarshi and Khashabi, Daniel and Ha-\njishirzi, Hannaneh [22] suggest that high-popularity questions can\nbe adequately answered using the parametric memory of the LLM,\nwhile lower popularity scores necessitate extra context. In Figure 2,\nwe observe this pattern for both versions of A DAPT -LLM, indicat-\ning that our model, despite lacking access to popularity scores during\ntraining or inference, has learned effective criteria for requesting ad-\nditional context.\n4.7 Comparison with state-of-the-art methods\nWe conducted a comparative analysis between our A DAPT -LLM\nmodel and the current state-of-the-art approach for PopQA proposed\nby Mallen, Alex Troy and Asai, Akari and Zhong, Victor and Das,\nRajarshi and Khashabi, Daniel and Hajishirzi, Hannaneh [22]. Their\nmethodology relies on the popularity score annotated in the PopQA\ndataset to determine whether a question requires additional context.\nTo establish the optimal threshold for determining question popular-\nity, Mallen, Alex Troy and Asai, Akari and Zhong, Victor and Das,\nRajarshi and Khashabi, Daniel and Hajishirzi, Hannaneh [22] split\nthe PopQA dataset into 75% as a development set for threshold de-\ntermination and 25% as a test set. In the original paper, they apply\nthis methodology to various LLMs available at that moment (Llama-\n2 was not released yet).\nTo ensure a fair comparison between A DAPT -LLM and the\npopularity-based method, we replicated their approach using the\nLlama-2 7B model to determine the best popularity score threshold\n(found to be 707,000) using the same PopQA development set. This\nallowed us to obtain results consistent with their methodology while\nutilizing our base LLM. Similar to the original results in Mallen,\nAlex Troy and Asai, Akari and Zhong, Victor and Das, Rajarshi and\nKhashabi, Daniel and Hajishirzi, Hannaneh [22] when using smaller\nmodels, the popularity score threshold is almost equivalent to always\nretrieving contextual information for Llama-2 7B. The IR usage is of\n99.86% as presented in Table 5. This clearly shows how the popular-\nity score method struggles with smaller size models, being GPT-3Model Configuration IR usage Accuracy\nPOPULARITY SCORE 99.86% 36.81%\nADAPT -LLM (NQ) 87.22% 35.30%\nADAPT -LLM (SQ UAD) 83.99% 37.29%\nTable 5 : Performance comparison of Llama-2 base models trained on\nthe SQuAD and NQ datasets for the A DAPT -LLM and P OPULARITY\nSCORE configurations. The later mimics the methodology proposed\nby Mallen, Alex Troy and Asai, Akari and Zhong, Victor and Das,\nRajarshi and Khashabi, Daniel and Hajishirzi, Hannaneh [22] with\nthe Llama-2 LLM as the base model.\nDAVINCI -003 the only model to get a IR usage below 80% in the\noriginal paper when using adaptive retrieval with the Contriever. Sub-\nsequently, we evaluated our A DAPT -LLM configuration on the same\n25% test set split and compared the outcomes with those obtained\nusing the method described by Mallen, Alex Troy and Asai, Akari\nand Zhong, Victor and Das, Rajarshi and Khashabi, Daniel and Ha-\njishirzi, Hannaneh [22]. This systematic comparison enabled us to\nassess the efficacy of our A DAPT -LLM model in relation to the cur-\nrent state of the art.\nThe results of this experiment are presented in Table 5. We observe\ncomparable performance between the replicated approach of Mallen,\nAlex Troy and Asai, Akari and Zhong, Victor and Das, Rajarshi\nand Khashabi, Daniel and Hajishirzi, Hannaneh [22] and A DAPT -\nLLM when trained on NQ and SQuAD datasets and tested on the\n25% subset of PopQA. It\u2019s worth mentioning that A DAPT -LLM does\nnot utilize any information from PopQA, unlike Mallen, Alex Troy\nand Asai, Akari and Zhong, Victor and Das, Rajarshi and Khashabi,\nDaniel and Hajishirzi, Hannaneh [22], who directly use the popu-\nlarity score and a 75% portion of PopQA dataset to find an optimal\nvalue for that popularity score. This methodology is not generalizable\nto other open-domain question answering tasks since the popularity\nscore is a unique feature of PopQA. However, A DAPT -LLM can be\napplied to any similar dataset. Given these characteristics, we be-\nlieve that the results obtained by A DAPT -LLM are even more signif-\nicant, offering comparable performance to an approach that utilizes\ndataset-specific information. These findings substantiate the validity\nof our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness even when trained\non datasets different from the one used for testing.\n5 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we introduce A DAPT -LLM, a LLM which learns to dis-\ncern when additional context is necessary for answering a question,\nrather than relying solely on its parametric memory. A DAPT -LLM\nis the result of fine-tuning a base LLM on an open-domain question\nanswering dataset that has been modified to differentiate between\nquestions answerable with the LLM\u2019s parametric memory alone and\nthose requiring supplementary context. To construct these training\ndatasets, we initially subject the base LLM to zero-shot evaluation to\ndetermine its accuracy in answering questions. For questions where\nthe model\u2019s response is incorrect, we train the LLM to generate a\nspecial token, \u27e8RET\u27e9, indicating the need for additional context.\nThrough extensive experiments conducted on the PopQA dataset,\nwe show that A DAPT -LLM performs better than its two fixed alter-\nnatives: never retrieving and always retrieving relevant context infor-\nmation. Furthermore, our findings highlight A DAPT -LLM\u2019s capabil-\nity to effectively discern the necessity of additional context, which is\nthe primary objective of this work.\nFor future investigations, we propose exploring methods to en-\nhance performance when utilizing an IR system, such as incorpo-\nrating learnable sequential retrieval techniques. Furthermore, we be-\nlieve it would be valuable to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the\ninteraction between training and testing datasets in the development\nof A DAPT -LLM systems.\n6 Acknowledgments\nThis work received partial support from the Basque", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 8606, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea712173-ff37-479e-8732-cd69b11fa933": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea712173-ff37-479e-8732-cd69b11fa933", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "txt/2404.19705v2.txt", "file_name": "2404.19705v2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49931, "creation_date": "04/2024", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17", "prev_section_summary": "The section discusses the performance and methodology of the ADAPT-LLM model, a language model designed for question answering tasks that dynamically decides whether to retrieve additional context or rely on its parametric memory.

However, these models still struggle\nwith complex problems that require multiple reasoning steps, frequently leading to\nlogical or numerical errors. While numerical mistakes can largely be addressed\nby integrating a code interpreter, identifying logical errors within intermediate\nsteps is more challenging. Moreover, manually annotating these steps for train-\ning is not only expensive but also demands specialized expertise. In this study,\nwe introduce an innovative approach that eliminates the need for manual annota-\ntion by leveraging the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to generate\nboth the process supervision and evaluation signals automatically. Essentially,\nwhen a LLM is well-pretrained, only the mathematical questions and their final\nanswers are required to generate our training data, without requiring the solu-\ntions. We proceed to train a step-level value model designed to improve the\nLLM\u2019s inference process in mathematical domains.

To address\nthis, the Program-of-Thought (PoT) framework [ 2] and Program-Aided Language (PAL) models [ 5]\nhave been developed, incorporating an external code interpreter to handle precise numerical and\nsymbolic computations. This integration is intended to mitigate the challenges associated with LLMs\u2019\nintrinsic calculation errors and enhance their accuracy and reliability in complex reasoning tasks.\nThese approaches, which often rely on self-consistency majority voting, do not reflect the natural\nprocess of mathematical problem-solving as human beings. This discrepancy arises because both\nthe CoT and PoT frameworks pursue a solution to its final answer regardless of the accuracy of\nintermediate steps. Unlike these approaches, humans tend to reassess and potentially alter their\nsolution path upon encountering a mistake or dead-end in the problem-solving process. This dynamic\n\u2217equal contribution\n\u2020Corresponding Author.arXiv:2405.03553v1  [cs.CL]  6 May 2024\nFigure 1: Our approach involves iterating through three distinct stages. First, we collect a mathemati-\ncal dataset that comprises pairs of questions and their corresponding final answers. Next, we employ\nMCTS on the policy and value models, denoted as \u03c0\u03b8kandV\u03d5krespectively, to generate both correct\nand incorrect solution paths along with the estimated value of nodes along those paths. Finally, we\noptimize and update the policy and value models using the data obtained from the second stage.\nmethod of tackling problems has been examined in the context of the Tree of Thoughts (ToT)\nframework [23], which is pertinent for tasks demanding non-trivial planning or search.\nOur work extends the research line of Tree of Thoughts, taking it beyond a purely LLM inference\nframework. We utilize the LLMs integrated with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to\nstrike a more effective balance between exploration and exploitation, enabling the generation of high-\nquality training data without professional human annotations. This approach has been thoroughly\ninvestigated in the context of board games, such as AlphaGo [ 16]. Notably, AlphaGo Zero [ 17],\narmed with the MCTS, showcases how a neural network model can progressively evolve without\nhuman knowledge, autonomously producing the Go game training strategies.\nAs the strategy ( i.e., solution) of mathematical problems, whether through textual analysis or coding\nsnippets, demands rigorous logical structuring. Consequently, training data for approaches like\nCoT or PoT typically undergo manual annotation by domain experts, e.g., MATH dataset [ 7]. We\nhypothesize that well pre-trained LLMs possess the necessary mathematical knowledge to generate\ncorrect reasoning; however, they require appropriate stimulation\u2014such as an improved prompt or\nsearch strategy\u2014to do so. In our research, solutions in the REACT format [ 22] including both textual\nanalyses and code snippets [ 19,8] are autonomously generated by a well pre-trained LLM equipped\nwith appropriate prompts and deliberate designed MCTS framework.\nOur data generator and filtering operate under two primary assumption: first, that the correctness of\nthe LLM predicted answer is positively correlated with the quality of the entire solution process, and\nsecond, that errors flagged by the code interpreter signal the low-quality or possibly false positive\nsolutions. This is a fundamental reason our training data necessarily consists only of question\nstatements and their final answers. Unlike in the Go game, where the final board configuration\ndirectly indicates a win or loss, our methodology requires validating the equivalence between the\nmodel\u2019s predicted answer and the actual final answer. The two underlying assumptions also offer\ninsight into the rationale behind the construction and training of the value model within the MCTS\nframework, where the value model is crafted to assess the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.\nEmpirically, we build an iterative training approach as shown in Figure 1, and justify our methodology\non the MATH dataset, which is an open-sourced dataset notorious for its challenging math problem-\nsolving nature. The inference results demonstrates two key points: first, that the integration of\nLMs with the value model and the MCTS framework can progressively generate high-quality math\nreasoning data autonomously; second, that the value model is instrumental in aiding the policy model\nto navigate more effective solution paths.\n2 Preliminary\nWe assume that for any given input question q, the solution process can be broken down into multiple\nreasoning steps.3Under this perspective, we conceptualize mathematical problem solving within the\ncontext of reinforcement learning.\n3We can facilitate this assumption by, e.g., segmenting the solution based on distinct stages or simply period.\n2\nConcretely, consider that the complete solution comprises Treasoning steps, at a given time t, we\nrepresent the partial solution as the state st, and the subsequent reasoning step that might be taken\nas the action at. In this scenario, the policy model is embodied by a large language model, and the\ntransition f(st+1|at,st)from one state to the next is accomplished through a simple operation of\nconcatenation.\n\u03c0\u03b8(at|st) =LLM (at|st) (1)\nst+1=Cat(st,at) (2)\nOur primary goal is to develop a step-level value model, denoted as V\u03d5(s), which is capable of\nassessing the confidence in the correctness of partial solution and guide the LLM in generating\nsubsequent reasoning steps.\nTo train the value model, we must first establish a definition for the reward. In the context of\nmathematical problem solving, we assign the reward r= 0to all non-terminal reasoning steps, and\nr=\u00b11to a correct/incorrect final answer.\nA common method to create the learning signal is to employ Monte Carlo (MC) evaluation.\n\u02dcV(st) =1\nNNX\ni=1r\u0010\na(i)\nt\u2032\u2265t,s(i)\nt\u2032>t|st\u0011\n, (3)\nwhere a(i)\nt\u2032\u2265tands(i)\nt\u2032>t, which are sampled in accordance with the policy model and the state transition\nfunction, represent the i-th simulation. Thus, r(\u00b7|st)means the reward of the final outcome in one\nsimulation. Then, for any given partial solution s, we can train the step-level value model V\u03d5using a\nsupervised regression loss defined as follows:\nLV\u03d5(s) =\r\r\rV\u03d5(s)\u2212\u02dcV(s)\r\r\r2\n. (4)\n3 Our Method\nIn above approach of MC evaluation, it requires multiple simulations from each state, which can\nbe practically inefficient. We propose employing the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm,\nwhich has the potential to reuse simulations and update the estimated values in a principled manner.\n3.1 MCTS Evaluation\nImagine we have a value model V\u03d5kand an LLM policy model \u03c0\u03b8k. Using these models, we can\nconstruct an inference algorithm powered by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This algorithm\nstarts with the initial state as its root and, through the synergistic use of policy and value networks,\nsystematically grows the search tree by adding new nodes. These nodes correspond to states deemed\nto have high potential based on the outcomes of simulated trajectories. Specifically within the\ncontext of mathematical problem-solving, we present the MCTS algorithm, focusing on its four key\noperations, as shown in the left four panels of Fig. 2.\nSelection During the", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 9373, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac07b6b8-4d2d-4d6e-a6be-5f5103e2a421": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac07b6b8-4d2d-4d6e-a6be-5f5103e2a421", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "txt/2405.03553v1.txt", "file_name": "2405.03553v1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43140, "creation_date": "05/2024", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17", "prev_section_summary": "The section discusses an innovative approach to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating them with the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework.

We propose employing the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm,\nwhich has the potential to reuse simulations and update the estimated values in a principled manner.\n3.1 MCTS Evaluation\nImagine we have a value model V\u03d5kand an LLM policy model \u03c0\u03b8k. Using these models, we can\nconstruct an inference algorithm powered by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This algorithm\nstarts with the initial state as its root and, through the synergistic use of policy and value networks,\nsystematically grows the search tree by adding new nodes. These nodes correspond to states deemed\nto have high potential based on the outcomes of simulated trajectories. Specifically within the\ncontext of mathematical problem-solving, we present the MCTS algorithm, focusing on its four key\noperations, as shown in the left four panels of Fig. 2.\nSelection During the i-th iteration of the MCTS, the process begins with s0, representing the initial\nstate or input question. The algorithm then proceeds to explore the tree Tkby selecting actions\naccording to the Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (UCT) principle or similar variations.\nThis selection process is mathematically represented as:\nat= arg max\na\u2208Tkh\n\u02c6Q(st,a) +Puct(\u03c0\u03b8k(a|st), N(s,a))i\n(5)\nwhere the state-action value \u02c6Q(s,a)and its visiting count N(s,a)are stored and will be updated\nwithin the tree as the search progresses. This iterative selection process continues until the algorithm\nencounters a leaf node.\nExpansion Considering the partial solution as a leaf node from the selection, this node can be\nexpanded. In other words, the probability of the next reasoning step (action) should be calculated.\nGiven that the LLM can generate an unlimited number of potential actions (token sequence), we\npractically constrain the action space by employing random sampling with higher temperature, which\nis used to ensure the diversity.\n3\nFigure 2: MCTS for step-level value evaluation.\nEvaluation Evaluation of the leaf node or partial solution st, identified during the selection phase, is\nconducted using a weighted sum as introduced in [16, 17].\n\u02c6V(st)(i)= (1\u2212\u03bb)\u00b7V\u03d5k(st) +\u03bb\u00b7r\u0010\na(i)\nt\u2032\u2265t,s(i)\nt\u2032>t|st\u0011\n(6)\nNote that the intermediate value estimation \u02c6Vin MCTS differs from the training signal \u02dcVdefined in\nEq. (3). The term r(\u00b7)denotes the reward obtained in the i-th simulation, by rolling out from state st.\nThe hyperparameter \u03bbserves to balance the contribution of the value network\u2019s estimation with the\nempirical reward obtained during the rollout. In AlphaGo Zero [ 17], a computationally efficient\nversion without rollout was adopted, specifically with \u03bb= 0. Given that our tree depth is much\nshallower than Go games ( e.g., a maximum depth of 8), expansions can easily reach a terminal node.\nConsequently, we also discard the rollout by setting \u03bb=Iterminal (st).\nBackup At the end of the i-th simulation, the nodes along the path from the root to the leaf node st\nundergo a backward pass update. The updates to their action-state values and visitation counts are\nexecuted according to the following rules:\nN(s,a)\u2190N(s,a) + 1, \u02c6Q(s,a)\u21901\nN(s,a)iX\nj=1\u02c6V(st)(j)(7)\nSelf-Eval After running Nsimulations with the MCTS algorithm, we obtain the final tree Tk,\nwhich stores the expanded nodes and their corresponding action-state values. Recognizing that\nV(s) =Ea[Q(s,a)], we can approximate the value using the tree resulting from the MCTS algorithm,\nas shown below:\n\u02dcV(st) =X\nat|st\u2192atN(st,at)1/\u03c4\nP\natN(st,at)1/\u03c4\u02c6Q(st,at) (8)\nwhere \u03c4is a temperature parameter. Considering that the transition function is deterministic, and\nassuming that Q(st,at) =r(st,at) +V(st+1) =V(st+1)for non-terminal nodes4, we can employ\ntheQvalues as training signals. This implies that we can directly fit the state-action value model as\nfollows.\n\u02dcV(st+1) =\u02c6Q(st,at) (9)\n3.2 Iterative Training\nInitialization Initially, our approach begins with a pre-training LLM as the policy model \u03c0\u03b81. We\nextend this model by adding an auxiliary linear layer with a tanh activation function, which works\nalongside the traditional softmax layer responsible for token prediction, as depicted in the rightmost\n4For terminal steps, the label is straightforwardly determined by the correctness of the final answer.\n4\nAlgorithm 1 Step-level Beam Search\nRequire: Beam sizes B1,B2, question q, policy model \u03c0\u03b8, value model V\u03d5, maximum steps T.\nEnsure: candidate paths C\n1:C= [q]\u2217B1,t= 1 \u25b7Initialization\n2:while t < T andnon-terminal path in Cdo\n3: Priority Queue Ct+1 \u25b7Max Heap\n4: forstinCdo\n5: Sample\b\na(b)\tB2\nb=1\u223c\u03c0\u03b8(a|st) \u25b7LLM can do B2samples in parallel.\n6: forb= 1toB2do\n7: st+1=Cat\u0002\nst,a(b)\u0003\n8: Add(st+1, V\u03d5(st+1))toCt+1 \u25b7 V\u03d5(st+1)as the key\n9: C \u2190 Top-B1ofCt+1\npanel of Figure 1. This design implies that the two models, \u03c0\u03b8andV\u03d5, share the majority of their\nparameters. The parameters of the linear layer associated with V\u03d51are randomly initialized, leading\nto an initial tendency of the LLM\u2019s value head to predict a value close to 0 at the first ( k= 1st) round\nof MCTS. However, as the simulations in the first round MCTS proceed, the rewards ( \u00b11) from\nterminal nodes are back-propagated to their parent nodes. This back-propagation process gradually\ncauses the estimated Qvalue ( \u02c6Q) to converge towards a value within the range of [\u22121,1].\nTraining Method From the tree Tkcontructed from the k-th round of MCTS, we can sample two\nsolution paths corresponding to terminal nodes with correct and incorrect final answers, denoted as\nx+andx\u2212, respectively. The value estimations for each node along these paths, as defined in Eq (9),\nhave been stored within the tree. We then apply a multi-task loss function to update both the policy\nand value models.\nL(\u03b8, \u03d5) =\u2212log\u03c0\u03b8(x+|q) +T(x+)X\nt=1\u2225V\u03d5(st)\u2212\u02dcV(st)\u22252+T(x\u2212)X\nt=1\u2225V\u03d5(st)\u2212\u02dcV(st)\u22252(10)\nwhere the first term represents the negative log-likelihood loss for next-token prediction in correct\nsolutions, and the second and third terms capture the loss in value prediction for both correct and\nincorrect solutions, respectively. T(x)denotes the number of steps for solution path x.\nWith the updated policy and value models \u03c0\u03b8k+1andV\u03d5k+1, we can advance to the next-round MCTS,\niterating this training process to enhance our models further.\n3.3 Inference\nMCTS For MCTS inference, it is necessary to set \u03bb= 0 in the evaluation as shown in Figure 2.\nUnlike in board games, during inference, we cannot verify the correctness of a path; therefore,\nwe consistently rely on the value model for node evaluation, including for terminal nodes. MCTS\ndemands multiple simulations to update visit counts, aiming to estimate a robust policy distribution.\nThis requirement becomes computationally intensive and time-consuming, rendering it impractical\nfor deployment in a production environment. Consequently, we simplify the MCTS inference process\nto a more straightforward top-down version that eliminates the need for a backup, referred to as\nStep-level Beam Search.\nStep-level Beam Search Given two beam sizes B1andB2, initially we can employ the LLM to\ngenerate B1\u00b7B2actions for the first step by sampling decoding. These generated actions are then\nevaluated using the step-level value LLM, from which the top- B1ones are selected. Subsequently, for\neach of these chosen actions, the LLM generates B2subsequent actions, yielding a total of B1\u00b7B2\nactions for the next step. The value-based LLM reranks them, and the best B1actions are picked.\nThis reranking and selection procedure is repeated iteratively.\nCrucially, with the special case of B1= 1, the step-level beam search enables the sequential streaming\noutput of each step, making it more practical for real-world production scenarios. The pseudo-code is\npresented in Algorithm 1.\n5\n4 Experiments\nWe investigate whether our approach can enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large\nlanguage models without human annotated solution process.\n4.1 Experimental Setup\nIn", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 8004, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3130116-244f-4706-95e8-d614ac4017ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3130116-244f-4706-95e8-d614ac4017ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "txt/2405.03553v1.txt", "file_name": "2405.03553v1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43140, "creation_date": "05/2024", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17", "prev_section_summary": "The section discusses an advanced method for Monte Carlo evaluation using the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, specifically tailored for enhancing mathematical problem-solving with large language models (LLMs).

The pseudo-code is\npresented in Algorithm 1.\n5\n4 Experiments\nWe investigate whether our approach can enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large\nlanguage models without human annotated solution process.\n4.1 Experimental Setup\nIn this study, we mainly investigate the math domain-specific language model, DeepSeekMath-Base-\n7B [15], pre-trained on a substantial math-related corpus but without any supervised fine-tuning. It\nis believed to possess necessary mathematical knowledge to tackle a wide range of mathematical\nproblems. For the training sets, we exclusively extract question and answer pairs from GSM8K [ 3]\nand MATH [ 7], omitting the human-annotated solution analysis. In total, our training set includes\nonly 15k question answer pairs and 0 solution process. In contrast, for the test sets, we evaluate our\napproach not only on GSM8K and MATH but also on the out-of-distribution dataset GaoKao2023 [ 8].\nTo assess the accuracy of the predicted answers, we utilize the math evaluation toolkit [26].\n4.2 Solution Generation via MCTS\nIn our setup, the training data lacks human-annotated solutions. Instead, we utilize the MCTS\nframework to generate detailed solution processes with the possibility of using Python code interpreter.\nInitially, for the first round of MCTS, the prompt used for our solution generation adheres to the\nREACT [ 22] format, incorporating 2 demonstrations randomly selected from a pool of 20 prepared\nexamples. Starting from the second round, having already fine-tuned our model, we employ a\nstraightforward prompt in our SFT XML format, without any demonstration. Two prompt examples\nare shown in Appendix 8.\nSpecifically, we iteratively generate data and train our policy and value models through K= 3rounds,\ncontinuing until the enhancement observed between any two consecutive rounds is incremental. In\nevery round, we build 10 trees for each question-answer pair and randomly sample both at most\n4 correct and 4 incorrect solution process. The ratio between positive and negative examples is\napproximately 1:1, with the count of positive examples in each round varying between 58k and 59k.\n4.3 Baselines\nProprietary and Open-Source Models We first compare our approach with strong proprietary and\nopen-source models, including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and GPT-4 [ 13], Llama2 [ 18], Llemma [ 1]. By\ndefault, we report the results obtained using Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting [ 20], along with the\nprompting results of PAL [5], due to its enhanced performance in mathematical reasoning.\nSupervised Fine-Tuning Models SFT models leverage high-quality seed data with process supervi-\nsion annotated from GPT-4 or human to enhance the their capabilities in complex reasoning scenarios.\nTo ensure a fair comparison, we primarily contrast our approach with the highest-performing SFT\nmodels that utilize an external tool - a Python code interpreter. These include MAmmoTH [ 25],\nMathCoder [19], ToRA [6], MARIO [26], MathGenie [11], and DeepSeek-Math-Instruct [15].\n4.4 Main Results\nWe report our in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) results in Table 2. Different from previous\nworks [ 25,19,6,26,11], our proposed AlphaMath does not rely on high-quality solutions annotated\nby humans or GPT-4, whether in the form of text analysis or code snippets. Such solutions typically\nbolster the model\u2019s reasoning abilities but also entail substantial costs associated with annotation.\nFurthermore, our method differs from prior research by not incorporating any external datasets ( e.g.,\nnew questions and solutions) beyond the GSM8K and MATH datasets.\nThe last four rows of Table 2 present our principal findings. First, we establish a baseline with\nthe inherent mathematical reasoning ability of DeepSeekMath-Base using our designed prompt\nin a 2-shot setting.

At each intermediate step, we\nretain the top- B1candidates to formulate the subsequent step. As we increment B1, a corresponding\ngradual improvement in performance is observed. Particularly, the setting of B1= 1, B2= 5holds\npractical significance, as it offers a step-level streaming output compared with majority voting @5,\nwhile also being more computationally efficient.\nUltimately, we evaluate our approach with the MCTS framework. In contrast to the construction of\ntraining data, here we construct a single tree with 30 simulations and a maximum of 5 child nodes.\nWhile MCTS demonstrates improved performance on more challenging datasets, attributed to its\nexpansive search space, its substantial computational demands curtail its practical applicability in\nreal-world scenarios.\nIn summary, our approach demonstrates that, even in the absence of high-quality GPT-4 or human-\nannotated solution processes, it remains competitive with or surpasses the performance of the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) on 7B LLMs.\n7\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 560708090100Solve Rate (%)round 1 round 2 round 3(a) Difficulty Level\nAlgebra Counting\n& ProbabilityGeometry Intermediate\nAlgebraNumber\nTheoryPrealgebra Precalculus60708090100Solve Rate (%)round 1 round 2 round 3 (b) Subject Type\nFigure 3: Problem Solving Rate on MATH Training Set\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5102030405060708090Solve Rate (%)round 0 round 1 round 2 round 3\n(a) Difficulty Level\nAlgebra Counting\n& ProbabilityGeometry Intermediate\nAlgebraNumber\nTheoryPrealgebra Precalculus1020304050607080Solve Rate (%)round 0 round 1 round 2 round 3 (b) Subject Type\nFigure 4: Problem Solving Rate on MATH Test Set\n4.5 Analysis 1: Problem Solving Rate of MCTS\nIn this experiment, we evaluate the successfully solving rate of MCTS across various rounds. Utilizing\nthe MATH dataset, which categorizes each problem by difficulty level and subject type, we compute\nthe problem-solving rate across different categories.\nFor our training set, we count the instances wherein problems are successfully solved along any of\nthe paths within the 10 constructed trees. As illustrated in Figure 3a, it becomes evident that MCTS\nachieves greater success in solving more challenging problems in subsequent rounds. Similarly,\nFigure 3b indicates that, in later rounds, MCTS consistently demonstrates an improved capability to\nsolve a broader array of problems across different subjects.\nFor the test set shown in Figure 4, we add the result of round 0, which corresponds to the performance\nof \u2018our prompt 2-shot\u2018 in Table 2. We can found the improvement of round 3 is not consistency for\ndifferent levels and subjects. For easy problems, the performance of round 3 even drops. This is the\nreason why we terminate our iterative training after round 3.\nFor the test set depicted in Figure 4, we include the results from round 0, which correspond to the\nperformance of our prompt 2-shot in Table 2. Unlike training set, we observe that the improvement\nobserved in round 3 is not consistent across different levels and subjects, even though the overall\naccuracy is slightly increased, which will be discussed in next section. In fact, for easier problems,\nthe performance in round 3 actually declines. This is the reason we terminate our iterative training\nprocess after round 3.\n4.6 Analysis 2: Inference Strategy\nIn this section, we explore the performance of our model under various inference strategies including\ngreedy decoding, step-level beam search, and MCTS.

Specifically, for step-level beam search, an enhancement\nin performance was observed with an increase in the beam size B1. Although MCTS exhibited\nthe highest performance, we previously noted its significant time consumption and computational\ninefficiency. Consequently, we provide a summary of the average problem-solving duration and\nthe average number of intermediate steps taken on the MATH dataset in Table 3. The data indicate\nthat MCTS demands the longest solving time and the highest number of steps, attributable to our\nconfiguration of 30 simulations and 5 leaf nodes. To achieve similar accuracy, step-level beam search\nwithB1= 3, B2= 5 is more computationally friendly. Additionally, we observe an intriguing\nphenomenon: a larger beam size B1tends to reduce the average problem-solving duration. This can\nbe attributed to the decrease in the number of average steps required when a larger B1is employed.\nDiscussion of Majority Voting It is challenging to directly compare maj@5 with step-level beam\nsearch due to the inherent differences in their methodologies. Maj@5 involves generating 5 complete\nsolutions with all intermediate steps considered. From the step-level perspective, for each step,\nmaj@5 will select 5 candidates based on 5 different candidates from the previous step. In contrast,\nour proposed beam search method (e.g., B1= 1, B2= 5) will generate B1\u00b7B2= 5candidates for\nthe current step but will ultimately retain only the top- B1= 1candidates, discarding the others. It\nmeans before proceeding to the next step, the step-level beam search is left with only 1 candidate.\nTherefore, theoretically, maj@5 is somewhat analogous to having some B1within the range [1,5].\nHowever, the specific mechanics of candidate selection and retention differ significantly.\n4.7 Analysis 3: Value Model\nIn Figure 6, we plot the fitted distribution of Q-values (as defined in Eq. (7)) for intermediate steps\n(excluding the terminal step) from the 3rd round of MCTS applied to our training dataset. For\ncorrect solutions, the distribution is markedly skewed towards a value of 1, with the majority of the\nprobability density concentrated near 1. In contrast, the distribution for incorrect solutions exhibits\na lesser degree of skewness, albeit with the bulk of the probability density leaning towards -1.

In other words, the correct intermediate steps have the potential to lead both correct and\nincorrect final answers. Thus, with the backup of MCTS, the Q-values of intermediate steps in\nincorrect solutions may also be updated with a reward of 1 during simulations.\n5 Related Works\nMath Dataset Recent works [ 20,2,19,5,8,23] on mathematical reasoning have made impressive\nprogress empowered by LLMs. However, the training data", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 8172, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9a5b761-aef2-495f-98c5-10b8e22a592e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9a5b761-aef2-495f-98c5-10b8e22a592e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "txt/2405.03553v1.txt", "file_name": "2405.03553v1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43140, "creation_date": "05/2024", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17", "prev_section_summary": "The section discusses the evaluation and analysis of different inference strategies and models for solving mathematical problems using datasets like MATH and Gaokao2023.

Thus, with the backup of MCTS, the Q-values of intermediate steps in\nincorrect solutions may also be updated with a reward of 1 during simulations.\n5 Related Works\nMath Dataset Recent works [ 20,2,19,5,8,23] on mathematical reasoning have made impressive\nprogress empowered by LLMs. However, the training data for all the aforementioned works are\ngenerated using formidable commercial models such as GPT-4 or through manual annotation, a\nprocess that hampers the scalability of the method and escalates the associated expenses. Unlike\nprevious work, we leverage the strong linguistic capabilities and math knowledge of a base model by\nintroducing Question-Answer pairs (Q&A pairs) data, and enhance the performance of this model\nthrough a self-improvement iteration strategy.\nValue/Reward Model Recent works [ 9,3,4,24,21] demonstrate that verification significantly\nimproves performance on math reasoning. Especially, Process-Reward Model(PRM)[ 9] solves 78%\nof problems from a representative subset of the MATH test set. Reward model is the source of the\ntraining signal in Reinforcement Learning(RL) [ 14,15]. Although these works[ 10,12] explore the\nincorporation of the value model into the decoding process, the value/reward model remains primarily\nutilized as an auxiliary tool in RL. In our work, we adopt a strategy that merges the value model\nwith the generative model, perfectly integrating the two models while also scoring the generated text\nduring the decoding process, thereby providing a richer set of decoding strategies, such as step beam\nsearch, MCTS.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this work, we have shown that a well-pre-trained large language model (LLM) can leverage Monte\nCarlo Tree Search (MCTS) to unlock its potential in identifying the correct mathematical reasoning\nprocess, independently of GPT-4 or a human-annotated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset. Through\nthe integration of iterative training with the policy and value models, the capability of the LLM to\nperform math reasoning tasks is significantly boosted. Notably, by applying step-level beam search,\nthe value model can be used to select a more reasonable solution path. For our future work, we aim\nto explore the impact of expanding the diversity of incremental question-answer pairs for each round\nof MCTS on the model\u2019s performance.\n10\nReferences\n[1]Zhangir Azerbayev, Hailey Schoelkopf, Keiran Paster, Marco Dos Santos, Stephen McAleer,\nAlbert Q Jiang, Jia Deng, Stella Biderman, and Sean Welleck.

We build 10 trees for each question-answer pair and randomly sample both at most 4\ncorrect and 4 incorrect solution process for training. In this setting, the ratio of positive to negative\nexamples is approximately 1:1, and the count of positive examples varies between 58k to 59k for\neach round.\nFor supervised fine-tuning , we set a learning rate of 4e-5, a batch size of 1024, set the weight of\nthe value loss to 0.01, and train the model for 10 epochs. We employ the AdamW optimizer and the\ncosine learning rate scheduler with the warmup rate set to 0.03.\n7.3 Datasets Details\nTable 4 presents the statistical data of the test set.\n8 Prompts\nWe provide instructions and examples for generating solutions and performing reasoning. For the\nsolution generation through MCTS in the first round, the pre-trained models such as DeepseekMath-\nbase [ 15] may not adhere to instructions.

On the\nother hand, existing open evaluator LMs exhibit\ncritical shortcomings: 1) they issue scores that\nsignificantly diverge from those assigned by hu-\nmans, and 2) they lack the flexibility to perform\nboth direct assessment and pairwise ranking,\nthe two most prevalent forms of assessment.\nAdditionally, they do not possess the ability\nto evaluate based on custom evaluation crite-\nria, focusing instead on general attributes like\nhelpfulness and harmlessness. To address these\nissues, we introduce Prometheus 2, a more pow-\nerful evaluator LM than it\u2019s predecessor that\nclosely mirrors human and GPT-4 judgements.\nMoreover, it is capable of processing both di-\nrect assessment and pair-wise ranking formats\ngrouped with a user-defined evaluation criteria.\nOn four direct assessment benchmarks and four\npairwise ranking benchmarks, PROMETHEUS\n2scores the highest correlation and agreement\nwith humans and proprietary LM judges among\nall tested open evaluator LMs. Our models,\ncode, and data are all publicly available1.\n1 Introduction\nEvaluating the quality of outputs produced by lan-\nguage models (LMs) is progressively becoming\ndifficult, as the outputs cover an extremely di-\nverse distribution of text and complex tasks. To\naddress this issue, language model-based evalua-\ntion has emerged as a scalable and cheap paradigm\nfor assessing LM-generated text (Li et al., 2024;\nGao et al., 2024). In this paradigm, LMs are ei-\nther prompted to output a scalar indicator of qual-\nity (denoted as direct assessment ) (Zheng et al.,\n\u2217equal contribution.

On the other hand, scores provided\nby strong evaluators highly correlate with each other.\n2023; Liu et al., 2023b; Ye et al., 2023; Kim et al.,\n2023) or to determine which of two outputs are pre-\nferred (denoted as pairwise ranking ) (Wang et al.,\n2023b; Li et al., 2023b; Lambert et al., 2024). Prior\nworks employing proprietary LMs as evaluators\nhave demonstrated not only high correlations with\nhuman evaluations but also increased speed and\ncost-effectiveness (Zheng et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\n2023b; Dubois et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023).\nHowever, relying on proprietary LMs for evalua-\ntion poses significant challenges. The lack of trans-\nparency about their training data compromises both\nfairness and compliance, making it problematic\nto use them in evaluation pipelines. Additionally,\nconcerns regarding controllability and affordability\nalso persist (Kim et al., 2023). To address these\nissues, recent works have focused on developing\nevaluator LMs that are open-access, transparent,\nand controllable (Kim et al., 2023; Wang et al.,\n2023a,b; Li et al., 2023a; Zhu et al., 2023; Jiang\net al., 2023b,c; Lee et al., 2024). Yet, these models\noften yield scoring decisions that do not correlate\nwell enough with human judgments or those made\nby proprietary LMs, failing to effectively simu-\nlate them. Moreover, open evaluator LMs are not\nflexible since they are typically trained only to per-arXiv:2405.01535v1  [cs.CL]  2 May 2024\nform either direct assessment or pairwise ranking\nand assess based on general public preferences like\nhelpfulness and harmlessness, limiting their ability\nto handle diverse real-life scenarios.\nTo close the gap with proprietary LMs, we in-\nvestigate unifying the two model-based evaluation\nparadigms - direct assessment and pairwise ranking\n- to train a robust unified evaluator LM. We propose\na recipe based on merging the weights of two eval-\nuator LMs trained separately on direct assessment\nand pairwise ranking formats. Our key empirical\nobservation is that weight merging can yield an\nevaluator LM that not only works in both formats,\nbut also outperforms evaluator LMs that are jointly\ntrained or only trained on a single format.\nTo demonstrate our approach, we develop the\nPREFERENCE COLLECTION , a new fine-grained\npairwise ranking feedback dataset that builds on\ntheFEEDBACK COLLECTION (Kim et al., 2023),\nwhich is a direct assessment feedback dataset. We\nchoose Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023a) and Mixtral-\n8x7B (Jiang et al., 2024) as our base models, and\nmerge the weights of evaluator LMs separately\ntrained on the FEEDBACK COLLECTION and the\nPREFERENCE COLLECTION to obtain our resulting\nmodels, P ROMETHEUS 2 (7B & 8x7B).\nOn four direct assessment benchmarks (Vicuna\nBench, MT Bench, FLASK, Feedback Bench), the\nPROMETHEUS 2models demonstrate the highest\ncorrelation with both human evaluators and pro-\nprietary LM-based judges compared to existing\nopen evaluator LMs, with the Pearson correla-\ntion surpassing other baselines by 0.2 units across\nall datasets. Similarly, on four pairwise ranking\nbenchmarks (HHH Alignment, MT Bench Human\nJudgment, Auto-J Eval, Preference Bench), the\nPROMETHEUS 2models show the highest agree-\nment with human evaluators among all the open\nevaluator LMs we tested, reducing the performance\ngap with GPT-4 in half.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n\u2022We introduce PROMETHEUS 2(7B & 8x7B),\nstate-of-the-art open evaluator LMs that score\nhigh correlations with both human evaluators\nand proprietary LM-based judges on both di-\nrect assessment and pairwise ranking.\n\u2022We introduce a pairwise ranking feedback\ndataset called the PREFERENCE COLLEC -\nTION , which includes 1K custom evaluation\ncriteria beyond helpfulness and harmlessness.\u2022We show that merging the weights of evaluator\nLMs trained on direct assessment and pairwise\nranking feedback datasets results in a unified\nevaluator LM that excels in both schemes.\n2 Related Work\n2.1 Language Model-based Evaluation\nTo assess the generation capabilities of LMs, prior\nworks such as the GEM benchmark (Gehrmann\net al., 2021, 2022) employed Rouge (Lin,\n2004), BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), and\nBERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) as their metric,\nwhich measures the lexical or semantic similarity\nbetween a reference answer and a response. How-\never, these conventional metrics are prone to false\nnegatives because they are not expressive enough\nto recognize responses that are of good quality but\ndiffer from the reference answer (Schluter, 2017;\nFreitag et al., 2020; Hanna and Bojar, 2021).\nRecently, employing language models as a judge\nhas gained attention as a promising paradigm to\nmimic the depth and granularity that human evalu-\nation offers (Zheng et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023b;\nLi et al., 2023b; Chan et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023).\nTo reduce the over-reliance on proprietary LMs,\nfollow-up works suggest training language models\nspecialized in evaluations (Cui et al., 2023; Kim\net al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023b,c; Li et al., 2023a;\nLee et al., 2024).

However, the scoring decision might change based on a specific evaluation criterion.\n3 Methodology\nWe propose a new recipe for training a unified\nevaluator LM based on merging the weights of\nmodels trained for direct assessment and pairwise\nranking. We begin with background on direct as-\nsessment and pairwise ranking for evaluator LMs\n(Section 3.1, 3.2), followed by the construction\nprocess of our training data (Section 3.3). Finally,\nwe present our methods to train the state-of-the-art\nevaluator LM, Prometheus 2 models (Section 3.4).\n3.1 Direct Assessment\nDirect assessment is mapping an instruction iand\nresponse rinto a scalar value score s, such as\nfdirect : (i, r)7\u2192swhere s\u2208R. For the scor-\ning range, we use a 1-5 Likert scale scoring.\nPrior works have identified several recipes to\nalign the scores provided by evaluator LMs ( sLM)\nand the scores assigned by humans ( shuman ). For\ninstance, Liu et al. (2023a) and Zheng et al. (2023)\nhave shown that it is crucial to add a reference an-\nswer aas input to the evaluator LM to maximize\nthe correlation between sLMandshuman . Also,\nZheng et al. (2023) and Ye et al. (2023) showed\nthat prompting the language model to write verbal\nfeedback vrbefore salso improves the correlation\nbetween sLMandshuman . Lastly, Ye et al. (2023)\nand Kim et al. (2023) showed that by explicitly\nintegrating evaluation criteria e, users can define\nthe standards for model assessment, ensuring eval-uations are flexible to specific needs rather than\ngeneric qualities. Specifically, eis represented as\na score rubric including a description for the cri-\nteria itself and a set of descriptions for each score\nbetween the scoring range. This is expressed as:\nfdirect : (i, r, a, e )7\u2192(vr, s)\nwhere s\u2208 {1,2,3,4,5}(1)\n3.2 Pairwise Ranking\nPairwise ranking is mapping an instruction iand\ntwo pair of responses (rm,rn)into either iorj,\nsuch as fpair : (i, rm, rn)7\u2192swhere s\u2208 {m, n}.\nSimilar to direct assessment, prior works have\nidentified that integrating a reference answer aand\nverbal feedback vrm,rninto the evaluation pipeline\nis crucial (Zheng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b,a).\nIn addition, to support granular assessment under\ncustom criterion, we add the evaluation criteria e\nas input to the evaluator LM (Ye et al., 2023; Kim\net al., 2023). To the best of our knowledge, we are\nthe first to study such fine-grained evaluation in\npairwise ranking settings. This is expressed as:\nfpair : (i, rm, rn, a, e )7\u2192(vrm,rn, s)\nwhere s\u2208 {m, n}(2)\nIn pairwise ranking, the evaluation criteria edo\nnot include a set of descriptions for each score;\ninstead, only the description of the evaluation cri-\nterion itself.

Note that the 1K evaluation criteria, 20K instruc-\ntions, and 20K reference answers are shared among the\ntwo datasets. Both datasets have an equal number of\nscoring decisions (\u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d; 100K each & 1-5; 20K\neach) to prevent unintended biases after training.\n3.3 The Preference Collection\nPopular pairwise ranking datasets such as HH-\nRLHF (Bai et al., 2022) or Ultra Feedback (Cui\net al., 2023) do not include an evaluation criteria\neand a verbal feedback vrm,rn. To obtain an eval-\nuator LM that could assess based on what users\ncare about, we construct the PREFERENCE COL-\nLECTION that includes 1K evaluation criteria.\nConstruction Process To construct the PREFER -\nENCE COLLECTION , we apply two modifications\nto the FEEDBACK COLLECTION . First, since the\nFEEDBACK COLLECTION includes five responses\nfor each instruction, each corresponding to a scor-\ning decision between 1 and 5, we pair two out of\nthe five responses, resulting in a total of ten combi-\nnations per instruction. Using the existing scoring\ndecisions for each response, we determine which\nresponse is better and assign a new scoring deci-\nsion for that pair ( i.e., \u201cResponse A is better\u201d or\n\u201cResponse B is better\u201d). Second, to generate new\nverbal feedback vrm,rnfor each pair of responses,\nwe prompt GPT-4-1106 to identify the commonali-\nties and differences of the two responses.\nThe statistics of the resulting dataset are listed in\nTable 1 along with the FEEDBACK COLLECTION .\nWe explain about our quality verification process\nof the PREFERENCE COLLECTION in Appendix A.\nAlso, we include the prompts we use for the aug-\nmentation process in Appendix F.\n3.4 Employing Evaluator Language Models\nPrompting Prompting involves querying an LM\nto make judgments in a specified evaluation format\nwithout training on any feedback dataset.Single-Format Training Single-Format training\ninvolves training a base model \u03b8on either on a di-\nrect assessment feedback dataset Ddor a pairwise\nranking feedback dataset Dp.\nJoint Training Joint training involves training a\nbase model \u03b8on both a direct assessment feedback\ndataset Ddand a pairwise ranking feedback dataset\nDp. This enables the resulting evaluator LM to\nfunction across both evaluation formats.\nWeight Merging Weight Merging involves train-\ning two models, \u03b8dand\u03b8p, separately on a direct\nassessment feedback dataset Ddand a pairwise\nranking feedback dataset Dp. Then, we obtain the\nfinal evaluator LM \u03b8final with linear merging :\n\u03b8final =\u03b1\u00d7\u03b8d+ (1\u2212\u03b1)\u00d7\u03b8p (3)\nWe conduct experiments by using \u03b1= 0.5. In\nSection 6.3, we observe how altering the coefficient\n\u03b1affects downstream performance on each evalua-\ntion scheme. We empirically find that this simple\nrecipe work best when we choose Mistral-7B as\nour base model. In addition to linear merging, we\nalso test different merging techniques including:\n\u2022Task Arithmetic merging (Ilharco et al.,\n2022) which can be expressed as follows:\n\u03b8final =\u03b8init+\u03b1\u00d7(\u03b8d\u2212\u03b8init)+\n(1\u2212\u03b1)\u00d7(\u03b8p\u2212\u03b8init)(4)\nwhere \u03b8initis the weight of the base model.\nHowever, we empirically find that the result-\ning evaluator LM \u03b8final often does not gener-\nate valid scoring decisions ( e.g., generating an\ninteger during pairwise ranking).\n\u2022TIES merging (Yadav et al., 2024), while\nsimilar to Task Arithmetic merging, adds (1) a\nTrim operation to remove redundant weights\nin the task vector \u03b8d\u2212\u03b8initand\u03b8p\u2212\u03b8init\nand (2) Elect andDisjoint operations to\nresolve disagreement ( i.e., opposite directed\nweights) between \u03b8d\u2212\u03b8initand\u03b8p\u2212\u03b8init.\n\u2022DARE merging (Yu et al., 2023), while also\nsimilar to Task Arithmetic and TIES merging,\nperforms a Random Drop andRe-scale\noperations in the task vector \u03b8d\u2212\u03b8initand\n\u03b8p\u2212\u03b8initto remove redundant weights.

Although it is\nimpractical for regular use, we make a fair compari-\nson by infinitely looping until scores can be parsed.\nAlso, we include proprietary LMs such as GPT-3.5-\nTurbo-0613; GPT-4-1106; and Claude-3-Opus.\nSingle-Format Trained Evaluator LMs For\nsingle-format trained evaluator LMs, we test\nPrometheus-7,13B (Kim et al., 2023) (direct assess-\nment); UltraRM-13B (Cui et al., 2023) (pairwise\nranking); and PairRM-0.4B (Jiang et al., 2023c)\n(pairwise ranking). In addition, we also report the\nperformances of single-format training Mistral-7B-\nInstruct-v0.2 and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 on\neither direct assessment or pairwise ranking.\nJointly Trained Evaluator LMs For jointly\ntrained evaluator LMs, we test Auto-J (Li et al.,\n2023a). In addition, we report the performances\nof jointly training Mistral-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on\nboth direct assessment and pairwise ranking.\nWeight Merging PROMETHEUS 2(7B & 8x7B)\nmodels are our weight merging baselines.\nDetails on the hyper-parameters for training and\ninference along with the prompt templates are all\nlisted in Appendix B, G, H.5 Experimental Results\n5.1 Direct Assessment Results\nThe direct assessment results are shown in Table 3.\nThe scoring decisions of P ROMETHEUS -2 models\n(7B & 8x7B), GPT-4-1106, Claude-3-Opus, and\nhuman evaluators all strongly correlate with each\nother, yielding Pearson correlations higher than 0.5\nregardless of the reference evaluator and bench-\nmark. On the other hand, base LMs, single-format\ntrained LMs, and jointly trained LMs show lower\ncorrelations with GPT-4-1106, Claude-3-Opus, and\nhumans, mostly falling below 0.5.\nNotably, PROMETHEUS 2models outperform\nPrometheus and Auto-J by at least 0.2 units across\nbenchmarks in their correlation with proprietary\nLMs. Moreover, on the FLASK benchmark, while\nthe correlation between humans and GPT-4 is\n0.679, the highest correlation previously achieved\nby Prometheus-13B with humans was 0.449, but\nPROMETHEUS -2-8 X7Bachieves a correlation of\n0.555 with humans, effectively halving the gap.\n5.2 Pairwise Ranking Results\nThe pairwise ranking results are shown in Table 4.\nWe exclude the results of Pair RM, Ultra RM on \u2018w/\nTie\u2019 settings since they could not give tie options.\nOn all of the 4 benchmarks, the PROMETHEUS\n2models achieve the highest scores, showing that\nthey could effectively simulate human judgments.\nNotably, while HHH Alignment is an in-domain\ntest set for Pair RM, and Auto-J Eval is for Auto-\nJ,PROMETHEUS -2-8 X7Bachieves higher scores.\nThis shows that training a large LM ( i.e., Mixtral-\nEvaluator LMHHH A LIGNMENT MT B ENCH HUMAN JUDG .

Moreover, the\nPROMETHEUS 2models at least halve the perfor-\nmance gap with proprietary LMs compared to ex-\nisting evaluator LMs on out-of-domain test sets.\n5.3 Consistency Across Evaluation Formats\nIn addition to obtaining high correlation and ac-\ncuracy, achieving high consistency is another im-\nportant aspect for evaluator LMs. Specifically, we\nconduct an experiment testing if evaluator LMs\ncould achieve consistent scores across different\nevaluation formats. To do this, we use pairwise\nranking benchmarks and measure the performance\ndifferences when prompted with direct assessment\nformats and pairwise ranking formats. Specifically,\nfollowing Kim et al. (2023), to process pairwise\nranking datasets in a direct assessment scheme, we\nevaluate each response separately and compare the\nscoring decisions. We mark it as correct if the eval-\nuator LM provides a higher score for the human-\nchosen response over the rejected one. As shown\nin Table 5, the results show that PROMETHEUS 2\nmodels show lower performance differences across\nevaluation formats, indicating their robustness.6 Discussions\nTo understand the effectiveness of our proposed\nweight merging method in the context of evalua-\ntions, we address the following research questions:\n\u2022RQ1 : Is Weight Merging more effective com-\npared to Joint Training? (Section 6.1)\n\u2022RQ2 : Is the effectiveness of Weight Merging\ndue to model ensembling? (Section 6.2)\n\u2022RQ3 : To what extent does learning with di-\nrect assessment help pairwise ranking perfor-\nmance, and vice versa? (Section 6.3)\n6.1 Weight Merging vs Joint Training\nTable 6 compares the performance of evaluator\nLMs trained via weight merging and joint training.\nAlongside this, we also add and compare the results\nof prompting and single-format training.\nSurprisingly, we observe that evaluator LMs\ntrained via joint training often show lower perfor-\nmance compared to single-format trained evalua-\ntor LMs, which indicates negative task transfer .\nSpecifically, evaluator LMs trained only on direct\nassessment formats obtain higher correlations com-\npared to jointly trained evaluator LMs across differ-\nent model scales.

Merging models trained with\nthe same evaluation formats (ensembling) underperforms merging models trained with different formats (unifying formats).\nonly on pairwise ranking formats obtain higher\naverage accuracy compared to multi-task trained\nevaluator LMs when using Mixtral-8x7B as a base\nmodel.\nOn the other hand, evaluator LMs trained via\nweight merging show superior performance not\nonly compared to jointly trained evaluator LMs\nbut also single-format trained evaluator LMs, in-\ndicating positive task transfer . Also, while both\nbenefit each other, merging the pairwise ranking\nevaluator LM weights improves direct assessment\nperformance more significantly than the reverse.\n6.2 Is the Effectiveness of Weight Merging\ndue to Model Ensembling?\nWhile we empirically find that weight merging\nworks effectively, it is unclear what might be the\nreason. One natural assumption might be that\nweight merging works effectively due to the ef-\nfect of ensembling multiple models. To check the\nvalidity of this hypothesis, we conduct an ablation\nexperiment by training multiple evaluator LMs on\ndifferent random seeds and merging them. Specif-ically, we merge two evaluator LMs trained on\ndirect assessment formats (denoted as \u2018Direct As-\nsessment & Direct Assessment\u2019) and two evaluator\nLMs trained on pairwise ranking formats (denoted\nas \u2018Pairwise Ranking & Pairwise Ranking\u2019). We\nuse Mistral-7B-Instruct as our base model.\nResults are shown in Table 7. Against our expec-\ntations, we observe that in the majority of cases,\nmerging evaluator LMs trained on the same eval-\nuation format does not improve evaluation perfor-\nmances. Specifically, on direct assessment bench-\nmarks, merging two evaluator LMs trained on di-\nrect assessment harms performance on average.\nSimilarly, on pairwise ranking benchmarks, merg-\ning two evaluator LMs trained on pairwise ranking\nalso harms performance on average. In contrast, by\nmerging two evaluator LMs each trained on direct\nassessment and pairwise ranking formats, the re-\nsulting evaluator LM shows superior performance\ncompared to different settings. This suggests that\nthe positive task transfer that occurs from weight\nmerging comes from unifying different evaluation\nformats, not by ensembling multiple models.\nDir ect Assessment Corr elationPair wise Ranking AccuracyA v erage P er f ormance(Dir ect Assessment : Pair wise Ranking) Mer ging RatioDir ect Assessment P earson Corr elation\nPair wise Ranking Agr eement AccuracyFigure 3: Finding the Optimal Alpha Value Direct As-\nsessment performances (colored in green) and Pairwise\nRanking performances (colored in blue) when altering\nthe\u03b1value to merge evaluator LMs trained on different\nformats.\n6.3 Quantifying Positive Transfer across\nEvaluation Formats\nTo explore how training on direct assessment feed-\nback data influences pairwise ranking accuracy and\nvice versa, we experiment by adjusting the \u03b1value\nduring linear merging. We evaluate the average\nperformance using all eight benchmarks in our ex-\nperiments. To illustrate the average performance\n(colored in black), we adjust the scale by multiply-\ning direct assessment Pearson correlations, origi-\nnally from 0 to 1, by 100 before averaging with\npairwise ranking accuracy.\nThe results are shown in Figure 3. For direct\nassessment benchmarks, evaluator LMs obtain the\noptimal performance when \u03b1is set to 0.5. This\nindirectly indicates that both pairwise ranking and\ndirect assessment feedback data contribute equally.\nOn the other hand, for pairwise ranking bench-\nmarks, the performance is optimal when \u03b1is set\nto 0.3. This also indirectly implies that while both\nbenefit each other, training on pairwise ranking\nimproves direct assessment performance more sig-\nnificantly than the reverse.\n7 Conclusion\nWe introduce PROMETHEUS 2, an open-source\nlanguage model specialized in evaluating other re-\nsponses. Unlike existing open evaluator language\nmodels that cannot effectively process both direct\nassessment and pairwise ranking\u2014the two most\nprevalent evaluation schemes\u2014 the PROMETHEUS\n2models demonstrate superior performance and\nconsistent results on both schemes, significantly\nnarrowing the gap with proprietary LM-based eval-\nuations. To train the PROMETHEUS 2models, wedevelop the PREFERENCE COLLECTION , the first\npairwise ranking dataset that includes over 1,000\ninstance-wise evaluation criteria beyond basic qual-\nities such as helpfulness and harmlessness. Notably,\nwe find that merging evaluator LMs trained on ei-\nther direct assessment or pairwise ranking formats\ncan lead to a unified evaluator LM with strong per-\nformance. We hope that our work encourages more\nresearch on using open-source language models as\nevaluators, moving away from reliance on propri-\netary models for fair and accessible evaluations.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Sungdong Kim, Seonghyeon Ye, Sohee\nYang, Dongkeun Yoon, and Hyeonbin Hwang for\ntheir helpful comments and discussions.\nReferences\nAmanda Askell, Yuntao Bai, Anna Chen, Dawn Drain,\nDeep Ganguli, Tom Henighan, Andy Jones, Nicholas\nJoseph, Ben Mann, Nova DasSarma, Nelson El-\nhage, Zac Hatfield-Dodds, Danny Hernandez, Jack-\nson Kernion, Kamal Ndousse, Catherine Olsson,\nDario Amodei, Tom Brown, Jack Clark, Sam Mc-\nCandlish, Chris Olah, and Jared Kaplan. 2021.

We ran-\ndomly sample 200 instances with different instruc-\ntions and conduct a three-part verification process.First, we assess the coherence ofvrm,rnwith the\nscoring decision ( i.e., \u2019A is better\u2019 or \u2019B is bet-\nter\u2019). Second, we evaluate the suitability ofvrm,rn\nagainst the evaluation criteria e. Lastly, to deter-\nmine the criticality of the feedback, we compare\nthe newly generated vrm,rnwith a concatenation of\nvrmandvrn. This aims to determine if vrm,rnef-\nfectively leverages the mutual information between\nrmandrn. Annotators then vote on whether vrm,rn\nor the concatenation of rmandrnis more critical.\nThe results are shown in Table 8.\nB Training and Inference\nHyperparameters\nThe configurations we used for prompting and train-\ning evaluator LMs are shown in Table 9, 10, 11.\nFor Auto-J, PairRM and UltraRM, we utilize their\nprompt template, inference hyperparameter men-\ntioned in the model cards or github repositories in\norder to ensure the configuration is optimal for a\nfair performance comparison. For proprietary LMs,\nPROMETHEUS 1, and PROMETHEUS 2models, we\nuse the same prompt template and evaluation con-\nfigurations.\nC Direct Assessment Results: Extended\nTable 12 and 13 (on the next page) shows the ex-\ntended results Table 3. Even when changing the\nmetrics to either Kendall-Tau and Spearman, the\noverall trends are maintained. PROMETHEUS 2\nshows superior evaluation performances among the\nopen evaluator LMs, achieving high correlations\nwith humans and proprietary LMs.\nD Consistency Experiment Results:\nExtended\nWe test if evaluator LMs could give consistent scor-\ning decisions in direct assessment formats. We\ninferencing multiple times with non-deterministic\ndecoding ( e.g., using temperature 1.0). Following\nthe experimental design from Ye et al. (2023), we\nchoose to inference 3 times and report the Krip-\npendorff\u2019s alpha value. As shown in Table 14, the\nresults indicate that training on feedback data only\nslightly improves consistency.

Join us!arXiv:2404.19296v1  [cs.CL]  30 Apr 2024\n1 Introduction\nThe rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing,\nenabling AI systems to understand and generate human-like text with remarkable accuracy. LLMs\nlike GPT-4 [ 29] and Anthropic [ 5], trained on vast datasets, can capture the nuances of language,\ncontext, and meaning, leading to a wide range of potential use cases across industries. These models\nexcel at various substream tasks, such as highly accurate language translation, sentiment analysis\nto gauge customer opinions and monitor brand reputation, question answering by drawing from\nextensive knowledge bases, and summarizing lengthy documents and articles. In healthcare, LLMs\ncan process patient data and medical literature to support disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and\ndrug discovery, even generating personalized patient reports [ 34,10]. The finance industry leverages\nLLMs for risk assessment, fraud detection, and automating financial report generation [ 44,20], while\nlegal domains benefit from streamlined contract analysis, legal research, and document drafting\n[16,26]. LLMs also have significant potential in education [ 34,37], providing personalized learning\nexperiences, generating content, and offering instant feedback. As LLMs continue to advance,\ntheir impact across various domains is expected to grow significantly, automating tasks, enhancing\ndecision-making, and driving innovation.\nSince Meta\u2019s release of the Llama3 model and its successor, Llama 2 [ 3], in 2023, the open-source\nlandscape for large language models (LLMs) has seen significant growth. This shift catalyzed the\ndevelopment of numerous innovative LLMs, each released at an unprecedented rate. As key players\nin this dynamic field, these models have significantly influenced natural language processing. We\nhighlight the most impactful open-source LLMs, including Mistral\u2019s sparse Mixture of Experts model\nMixtral-8x7B [ 4,21], Alibaba Cloud\u2019s multilingual Qwen1.5 series [ 6], Abacus AI\u2019s Smaug [ 32],\nand 01.AI\u2019s Yi models [ 49] that focus on data quality. Other notable models include Databricks\u2019 fine-\ngrained MoE model DBRX [ 40] , Upstage AI\u2019s depth-upscaled SOLAR-10.7B [ 23] , Allen Institute\nfor AI\u2019s alignment-focused TULU 2 and the collaborative OLMo series [ 18], Microsoft\u2019s WizardLM\npowered by Evol-Instruct [ 46], Berkeley\u2019s Starling-7B [ 53], Google DeepMind\u2019s Gemini-inspired\nGemma models [ 17], xAI\u2019s Grok [ 30], and Deci AI\u2019s high-efficiency DeciLM-7B [ 38]. In April 2024,\nwe witnessed the most powerful open-source model up-to-date, Meta\u2019s Llama3 [ 39] , and its 70B\nparameter version achieved an impressive inference speed of approximately 300 tokens per second\nusing Groq [ 39]. Shortly thereafter, more powerful open-sourced on-device models were released,\nincluding Microsoft\u2019s Phi-3-mini with 3.8 billion parameters [ 1] and Apple\u2019s OpenELM family [ 28]\nof models which range from 1 to 3 billion parameters. These diverse models cater to various use\ncases, so that the users may select the optimal model based on the use case.\nGraph data structures have emerged as a powerful tool for representing complex relationships and\ndependencies in various domains. In computer science, a graph consists of a set of nodes (or vertices)\nconnected by edges, which can be directed or undirected. This flexible structure allows for the\nrepresentation of intricate connections and hierarchies that are difficult to capture using linear or\ntabular formats. Graphs offer several advantages over other data structures, including efficient\ntraversal, pattern discovery, and the ability to model real-world networks. Many prominent companies\nhave leveraged graph-based approaches to enhance their products and services. For example, Pinterest\nuses a graph structure to represent the relationships between users, boards, and pins, enabling\npersonalized content recommendations and improved user engagement. Similarly, social networks\nlike Facebook and LinkedIn rely on graph representations to model user connections, facilitating\nfeatures such as friend suggestions and professional networking. In the context of integrating open-\nsource language models, graph structures can be employed to represent the relationships between\ndifferent models, their capabilities, and their optimal use cases. By treating each language model\nas a node in the graph and establishing edges based on their compatibility, complementary features,\nor task-specific performance, we can create a powerful framework for seamless model integration,\nintelligent query routing, and optimized performance.\nThe advent of on-device AI models has revolutionized the landscape of natural language processing,\noffering a host of advantages over traditional cloud-based approaches. These models, exemplified by\nGoogle\u2019s Gemma2B and the Llama7B model, are designed to run directly on user devices, ensuring\ndata privacy by processing queries locally and eliminating the need for network communication with\ndistant servers. This local processing not only enhances security but also reduces latency, enabling\nreal-time interactions and improved user experiences. On-device AI agents, such as Octopus v2\n[11,13], v3 [ 12], leverage these capabilities to provide intelligent assistance. However, the true\n2\npotential of on-device AI lies in its seamless integration with cloud-based models, giving rise to\nthe concept of cloud-on-device collaboration [48,36]. By harnessing the power of both on-device\nand cloud-based models, AI systems can achieve unprecedented levels of performance, scalability,\nand flexibility. This collaboration allows for the efficient allocation of computational resources,\nwith on-device models handling lighter and private tasks and cloud-based models tackling more\ncomplex or resource-intensive operations. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role\nin enabling this collaboration, connecting a vast network of devices and facilitating the exchange\nof data and insights between on-device and cloud-based models. The integration of on-device AI,\ncloud-based models, and IoT represents a paradigm shift in AI development. This approach combines\nthe strengths of each component, creating a synergistic ecosystem that can adapt to the diverse needs\nof users and applications. As we continue to explore the potential of cloud-on-device collaboration,\nwe can expect to see significant advancements in the field of AI.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new framework to use language models by constructing a graph with\ndifferent vertical language models as the nodes. We use the feature of Octopus v2 model and use\nit as the coordinator.

Classic graph algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-\nfirst search (DFS), have been extensively studied and optimized for various graph representations.\nDijkstra\u2019s shortest path algorithm and its variations have been crucial in solving routing problems and\nfinding optimal paths in weighted graphs. The PageRank algorithm [ 7], famously used by Google to\nrank web pages, has revolutionized the field of information retrieval and inspired numerous graph-\nbased ranking techniques. Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) [ 51,45,35,47]\nhave pushed the boundaries of graph-based learning, enabling the processing of graph-structured data\nfor tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph generation. Frontier research in this\narea includes the development of more expressive and efficient GNN architectures, such as Graph\nAttention Networks (GATs) [ 42,8] and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) [ 50,43], which have\nachieved state-of-the-art performance on various graph-related tasks.\nEnhancing AI agents with functional tokens Building on the Octopus series (v1 to v3)[ 13,11,12],\nthis research extends the capabilities of AI agents by utilizing functional tokens, and uniting all\nthe open source models. These earlier versions effectively harnessed these tokens for advanced\nfunctionalities. We now investigate their extended use in integrating diverse open source language\nmodels. Our studies indicate that functional tokens exceed mere precision in classification tasks,\nsuch as selecting suitable functions or models for processing queries. Importantly, they amplify the\nOctopus model\u2019s ability to interpret and reshape user queries into an optimal format for the designated\nfunction, enhancing performance. This synergy between functional tokens and the Octopus models\u2019\ncapabilities in classification and query reformulation has been further applied in graph structures.\nHere, a pivotal aspect involves transferring information between nodes and selecting the appropriate\nneighborhood for this transfer. Our enhanced Octopus model efficiently selects the best neighbor,\nrestructures the information at the current node, and transmits optimized information to subsequent\nnodes.\nMulti-agent LLMs Multi-agent LLMs mark a pivotal evolution in AI, facilitating collaborative\nproblem-solving through the integration of multiple specialized agents [ 52]. Unlike traditional single-\nagent LLMs, these multi-agent systems harness collective intelligence from agents specialized in\nvarious domains. This collaborative approach yields more comprehensive solutions to complex issues.\nMulti-agent LLMs excel in delivering domain-specific expertise, enhancing problem-solving abilities,\nand offering robustness, reliability, and adaptability. These systems promise transformative impacts\nacross sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and customer service by providing tailored expertise,\npersonalized interactions, and efficient decision-making processes. However, deploying multi-agent\nLLMs involves challenges such as integration difficulties, data sharing issues, and maintaining smooth\ncoordination between agents. Ongoing research into multi-agent LLMs is exploring possibilities like\ncross-domain expertise and real-time collaboration while considering ethical aspects. Additionally,\nthe adoption of graph architectures in our paper is also inspired by the multi-agent system. Advanced\n3\nfunctionalities like parallel function calling can be achieved through self-connections and sequential\naction processing via graph traversal , enhancing their operational efficiency and scalability.\nLLM scaling law Scaling laws [ 22] for Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized\nour understanding of the relationship between model size, dataset size, computational resources,\nand performance. These laws indicate that larger models trained on vast datasets with ample\ncomputational power generally outperform smaller ones. However, as LLMs continue to scale\nup, they face significant challenges related to server capacity and power consumption, which limit\ntheir further expansion. Our proposed architecture addresses these scalability issues by leveraging\ndistributed computing and node expansion techniques, enabling nearly unlimited node scalability .\nWe can create more powerful language model system by adding more nodes, bypassing the limitations\nimposed by server quantity and power supply.\n3 Methodology\nThis section outlines the primary methods for incorporating language models as nodes within a graph\nand provides details on the system architecture tailored for real applications. It also discusses the\ntraining strategy for the Octopus model using a synthetic dataset. Also, we highlight the system\ndesign for such a graph of language models in a production environment.\n3.1 Language model for classification from Octopus v2\nIn the Octopus v2 paper, we introduced a method named functional token for classification within a\nfixed pool. The Octopus v2 model effectively handles the task of\nP(f, params |q), (1)\nwhere fdenotes a choice from the set F, and params represents the reformulated information\nderived from the query q. The paper illustrates this method\u2019s application in the task of function\ncalling. Additionally, the functional token can be adapted to other similar scenarios that require\nselecting the optimal choice from a specified pool and reformulating the query to transfer information\nto subsequent nodes. In typical use cases involving a predefined graph, each node, represented as a\nlanguage model, has a fixed number of neighbors. To perform language model inference, the best\nneighboring node is selected, and information from the current node is passed to the next. Thus, the\nOctopus v2 model is well-suited for handling this problem, demonstrating both rapid execution and\nhigh accuracy as documented in the Octopus v2 paper.\n3.2 Language models as nodes in graph\nConsider a directed and heterogeneous graph defined as:\nG= (N, E ), (2)\nwhere Ndenotes the various nodes within the graph, and Erepresents the edges that connect\nthese nodes. Nodes are distinguished into two types: master nodes ,Nm, which coordinate queries\nby directing them to the suitable worker nodes ,Nw, and transfer necessary information for task\nexecution. Worker nodes receive information from the master node and execute the required tasks,\nusing an Octopus model to facilitate further coordination. The process of the node information\ntransfer is demonstrated in the Figure (2). For processing user queries qand generating responses y,\nwe model the probability as:\nP(y|q) =P(y|q;G). (3)\nFor a single-step task involving only one worker node, the procedure can be defined as follows:\nP(y|q;G) = P(Nw, qh|q;Nm)| {z }\nThe Octopus v2 pattern problemP(y|qh;Nw) (4)\nHere, P(Nw, qh|q;Nm)uses an Octopus v2 model to select the best neighboring worker node for\nNmand reformat the query into qh, which is the reformated query.

Consider a scenario where the Octopus model\u2019s neighbors are MathGPT [ 27],\nLawGPT [ 14], HealthCareGPT [ 2], CodeGPT [ 15], and RoomGPT [ 33]. The Octopus model can identify the\nmost relevant GPT and transform the initial query into a format best suited for the selected GPT.\nproblem that can be solved by Octopus model, which has the same structure as the equation (1). The\nlikelihood P(y|qh;Nw)is calculated by the language model situated at the worker node.\nFor multistep tasks, typical in multi-agent workflows, the process involves several sequential interac-\ntions among multiple nodes, as follows:\nP(y|q;G) =k\u22121Y\ni=0P(Nw\ni, qhi|q;Nm\ni)| {z }\nThe Octopus v2 pattern problemP(y|qhi;Nw\ni) (5)\nThis formula expands the single-step task to multiple steps, each handled by potentially different\nworker nodes, coordinated by their respective master nodes.

This method exemplifies a coordination and execution pattern in a distributed AI\nsystem, leveraging the capabilities of multiple specialized agents within a graph-based framework.\nFor the graph, it would be a predefined graph based on the available language models.

Each step processes a part of the query\nand contributes to the final outcome, with krepresenting the number of steps or interactions in the\nmulti-agent process. This method exemplifies a coordination and execution pattern in a distributed AI\nsystem, leveraging the capabilities of multiple specialized agents within a graph-based framework.\nFor the graph, it would be a predefined graph based on the available language models. Each worker\nmodel can also be an Octopus model that can take actions. If we are going to take a parallel function\ncalling, the master node will direct the query to the same nodes multiple times to execute the parallel\nfunction calling.\nCompared to a large language model like GPT-4, this design has another advantage that to answer\none query from the user, we only need to activate two small language models rather than a large\nlanguage model with trillion parameters. This means we can expect faster speed and less energy cost,\nand fewer demands on the hardware. In Octopus v2, we have demonstrated that we can use functional\ntoken to get rid of RAG method to achieve accurate selection of functions, and fast generation. Thus,\nequation (4) is executed fast.\n3.3 Task planning using graphs for multistep operations\nIn multistep task planning, incorporating numerous steps is essential. Traditionally, all available\nfunctions were listed in the context and submitted to a language model, which then generates plans\nbased on user queries. This approach, however, faces limitations when the language model, especially\n5\nthose with less than 10B parameters, attempts to process lengthy function descriptions. Such models\nstruggle to grasp extensive descriptions effectively. Moreover, this method didn\u2019t consider the inherent\nrelevance among different function descriptions. To address these challenges, constructing a graph\nthat maps the relevance between various nodes (language models/agents) offers a viable solution.\nThis graph-based approach ensures that only neighboring nodes relevant to a specific node are\nconsidered, significantly reducing the complexity of choices compared to the total number of function\ndescriptions. By leveraging the capabilities of the Octopus v2 model, this strategy enhances efficiency,\nenabling rapid query redirection and reformatting. We actually have two layers of abstraction. Firstly,\nfor each language model, we can apply the functional token to make it as a single AI agent which can\ntake single function callings. Or, the single node/language model can be an ordinary language model\nlike Llama3 or Phi3 which can do question and answering, writing etc. The other layer of abstraction\nis that we can also create another Octopus v3 model to choose from different nodes. The two layers\nof abstraction is demonstrated in the Figure (3)\nO c t o p u s  v 2 - 1\nO c t o p u s  v 2 - 3O c t o p u s  v 2 - 2\nFigure 3: In our design, the architecture consists of two abstraction layers. The first layer utilizes functional\ntokens to represent the actions executable by the Octopus v2 model. This layer encompasses three distinct\nOctopus v2 models, each identified by different functional tokens, effectively differentiating them as separate AI\nagents. The second layer of abstraction pertains to the Octopus v4 model, where internal functional tokens are\nmapped to various v2 models. For simplicity, we only include three v2 models, but one can map to multiple v2\nmodels in real use cases.\n3.4 Functional token and dataset collections\nLike the functional token architecture in Octopus v2, we conceptualize each model as a distinct\nfunction, utilizing functional tokens to activate specific model usage. This approach simplifies\nthe function design for language models, requiring only a single input argument and output result.\nAdditionally, for specific models, we can detail the required prompt template within the function\u2019s\ndoc string. This allows the Octopus v4 model to restructure the original query to match the expected\nformat. For instance, a function dedicated to processing legal information might be described as\nfollows:\ndef law_gpt(query):\n\"\"\"\nA specialized language model equipped to handle queries related to\nlegal studies, including international law, jurisprudence, and\nprofessional law. This model serves law students, practicing lawyers,\nand professionals in the legal field needing detailed legal\nexplanations or interpretations. This model also reformats user queries\ninto professional legal language.\nParameters:\n6\n- query (str): A detailed prompt that encapsulates a law-related\nquestion or issue. Speak in a professional legal manner.\nReturns:\n- str: Comprehensive legal analyses, solutions, or information related\nto the law query.\n\"\"\"\nAdditionally, when we construct the dataset using similar strategy to Octopus v2 paper. Following the\nmethodology outlined in the Octopus v2 paper, we can train multiple functional tokens corresponding\nto various custom language models. As in the Octopus v2 paper, the dataset collection process\ninvolves using synthetic data to train the functional tokens. To better accommodate diverse queries, it\nmay be beneficial to increase the temperature during data generation. This adjustment helps capture\nthe variability and potential formatting inconsistencies in user queries, which are common in certain\nuse cases.\n3.5 System design of language model graph\nThis section details the system architecture of a complex graph where each node represents a language\nmodel, utilizing multiple Octopus models for coordination. As we prepare for production deployment,\nit\u2019s crucial to integrate a load balancer to manage system demands efficiently. Below, we delineate\nthe system into several manageable components, emphasizing the core methodologies:\n\u2022Worker node deployment : Each worker node Nwcorresponds to an individual language\nmodel. We propose employing a serverless architecture for these nodes, specifically recom-\nmending Kubernetes [ 25] for its robust autoscaling capabilities based on memory usage and\nworkload. We also limit the model parameters of all worker nodes to under 10B.\n\u2022Master node deployment : The master node should utilize a base model with fewer\nthan 10B parameters (we use 3B model in the experiment), enabling deployment on edge\ndevices. Each worker node interfaces with an Octopus model for enhanced coordination. As\ndemonstrated in Octopus v2, a compact Lora model can be integrated to extend functional\ntoken capabilities. We suggest using a single base model supplemented by multiple Loras,\none per worker node. The LoraX library, an open-source initiative, is recommended for\nmanaging the inference operations with this configuration.\n\u2022Communication : Worker and master nodes are distributed across various devices, not\nconfined to a single unit. Thus, internet connectivity is essential for transmitting data\nbetween nodes. While the master node may be situated on smart devices, worker nodes are\nhosted in the cloud or on alternate devices, with results relayed back to the smart device. To\nsupport data caching needs, including chat history storage, we recommend utilizing Redis\n[9], a high-performance, in-memory database that facilitates distributed caching.\nThe overall system design architecture is depicted in Figure (4).\n4 Experiments\nIn this section, we detail the experiments performed with our framework, aimed at enhancing language\nmodel performance via multi-node collaboration. We demonstrate how our framework can improve\nlanguage model efficacy using the MMLU benchmark [ 19] for evaluation. For this purpose, we apply\n17 distinct models across the MMLU tasks. Upon receiving a user query, the Octopus v4 model\ndirects the query to the relevant specialized model, which then reformats it suitably. The following\nexperiment employs a simple graph; a more complex graph will be provided on our GitHub repo\n(https://github.com/NexaAI/octopus-v4 ) in the future. And the ultimate graph needs the\neffort from the whole community.\n4.1 Specialized models\nThe Multitask Multi-Language Understanding (MMLU) encompasses 57 unique tasks, further\ncategorized into 17 consolidated groups as recommended by the authors.

Octopus\nv4 achieves significant improvement in MMLU scores, requiring only a small sacrifice of tokens due to the\nutilization of functional tokens.\n\u2022Other : For remaining tasks, the Phi3 model ( https://huggingface.co/microsoft/\nPhi-3-mini-128k-instruct ) is employed as a general-purpose model.\n4.2 MMLU benchmark evaluation\nThis section presents a benchmark evaluation of the Octopus v4 system, comparing its performance\nwith other renowned models using the MMLU benchmark to demonstrate our model\u2019s effectiveness.\nIn our inference system, we utilize two compact language models: the 3B parameter Octopus v4\nmodel and another worker language model with no more than 8B parameters. The comparison is\nshown in Figure (5). The procedure of the inference is demonstrated in Figure (2).\nOne example of the user query is highlighted below:\nQuery: Tell me the result of derivative of x3when xis 2?\nResponse: <nexa_4> (\u2019Determine the derivative of the function f(x) =x3at the point\nwhere xequals 2, and interpret the result within the context of rate of change and tangent\nslope.\u2019)<nexa_end>\nNote that <nexa_4> is a functional token which maps to math gpt.\n5 Discussion and future works\nIn this section, we highlight a tutorial to train specialized model. Also, we outline the future plan of\nour team.\n9\n5.1 How to train a vertical model\nTo effectively fine-tune a large language model for domain-specific expertise, begin by gathering a\nsubstantial corpus of high-quality, domain-relevant data. This collection should include textbooks,\nresearch papers, articles, and other pertinent materials that thoroughly address the domain. It is\ncrucial to ensure the data is diverse, well-organized, and embodies the domain knowledge intended\nfor the model. Proceed by preprocessing this data\u2014cleaning, consistent formatting, and addressing\nany specialized jargon or terminology.\nSelect a pre-trained large language model that suits your needs, and use the preprocessed domain-\nspecific data for fine-tuning. This process adjusts the model\u2019s parameters to specialize in your chosen\ndomain, effectively embedding the necessary expertise. Optionally, consider employing knowledge\ndistillation to transfer insights from a larger model\u2019s API to a smaller, more efficient model. For\nthis fine-tuning phase, the SFT trainer ( https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/sft_trainer )\nprovided by Hugging Face offers a user-friendly interface. We recommend to use supervised fine-\ntuning followed by a direct preference optimization.\n5.2 Future work\nOur current GitHub project focuses on developing a graphical framework for language models,\ncurrently in its starting phase. We plan to enhance this framework by integrating a variety of vertical-\nspecific models and including the advanced Octopus v4 models with multiagent capability. Future\nreleases will feature more robust graphical representations in this repository. And the GitHub repo\nwill be maintained carefully by Nexa AI. Compared with scaling law of larger model, dataset, our\nframework is not limited and we could create a large graph.\nAdditionally, we are developing Octopus 3.5, a multimodal model that processes vision, audio, and\nvideo data. Subsequent versions will incorporate this AI agent into our graphical framework. Nexa\nAI also aims to develop compact, specialized models for diverse vertical domains.\n10\nReferences\n[1]Marah Abdin, Sam Ade Jacobs, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Jyoti Aneja, Ahmed Awadallah, Hany Awadalla,\nNguyen Bach, Amit Bahree, Arash Bakhtiari, Harkirat Behl, et al.

Under review.arXiv:2404.16994v2  [cs.CV]  29 Apr 2024\nAbstract\nVision-language pre-training has significantly elevated performance across a wide\nrange of image-language applications. Yet, the pre-training process for video-\nrelated tasks demands exceptionally large computational and data resources, which\nhinders the progress of video-language models. This paper investigates a straight-\nforward, highly efficient, and resource-light approach to adapting an existing\nimage-language pre-trained model for dense video understanding. Our preliminary\nexperiments reveal that directly fine-tuning pre-trained image-language models\nwith multiple frames as inputs on video datasets leads to performance saturation\nor even a drop. Our further investigation reveals that it is largely attributed to the\nbias of learned high-norm visual features. Motivated by this finding, we propose\na simple but effective pooling strategy to smooth the feature distribution along\nthe temporal dimension and thus reduce the dominant impacts from the extreme\nfeatures. The new model is termed Pooling LLaV A, or PLLaV A in short. PLLaV A\nachieves new state-of-the-art performance on modern benchmark datasets for both\nvideo question-answer and captioning tasks. Notably, on the recent popular Video\nChatGPT benchmark, PLLaV A achieves a score of 3.48 out of 5 on average of\nfive evaluated dimensions, exceeding the previous SOTA results from GPT4V (IG-\nVLM) by 9%. On the latest multi-choice benchmark MVBench, PLLaV A achieves\n58.1% accuracy on average across 20 sub-tasks, 14.5% higher than GPT4V (IG-\nVLM). Code is available at https://pllava.github.io .\n1 Introduction\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in image\ncomprehension when trained on large-scale image-text pairs [ 18,53,29,27,13]. Analogous to\nthe image domain, the recent video understanding models also explore a similar pipeline to fine-\ntune LLMs on large-scale video-text data [ 3,19,20]. However, this method suffers a high cost\nof computing resources and video data annotations. A more pragmatic approach is to adapt the\npre-trained image-domain MLLMs to video data [33, 30, 16].\nAn intuitive method for image MLLM adaption is to encode multiple video frames into a sequence\nof features and directly feed them into MLLMs, as the Large language Models(LLMs) [ 41,40]\nare native for processing sequential features and shown to be capable of understanding temporal\ninformation [ 24,31]. However, we empirically found two technical challenges when extending\nimage MLLMs to video data in this way. First, compared to zero-shot applications, training the\nimage MLLM on video data does not always increase the performance but introduces performance\nvulnerability to the change of inquiry prompts. Secondly, increasing the size of the language model\ncomponent does not improve the video understanding performance. Those two observations are\ncounter-intuitive since scaling up model sizes and exposing models to more downstream data are\ntypically considered beneficial for model performance.\nWe then conducted a series of studies to investigate the root cause of these two observations. For\nthe first one, we found it is mainly due to the limited information encoded by the image encoder.\nWhen experimenting on LLaV A [ 29] with 4-frame inputs, we experimentally found that, as shown\nin Figure 3, some visual feature tokens have dominantly larger norms over the others during the fine-\ntuning process. These tokens lead to shorter text descriptions with lower quality. As demonstrated\nin Figure 2, the 4-frame models tend to generate shorter texts with training on more samples. We\nconjecture that the large-norm features have obtained global video information and thus suppress\nthe norms of other tokens, due to the softmax calculation during the self-attention. This leads the\ngenerated description to be short. Even worse, if the prompt template changes, the learned MLLMs\nwould completely collapse, leading to rather short descriptions or even no response. We observe that\nadding more video frames could mitigate the suppression of the majority of the tokens. However, this\nwould lead to significantly larger memory consumption.\nThus, there is a trade-off between the number of frames and the computation cost. The intuitive way\nis to downsample the video frames. However, directly averaging the spatial and temporal dimensions\nas has been done in VideoChatGPT [ 33] loses too much spatial information and also does not achieve\noptimal performance during the scaling of the training dataset. Thus, the target is to find the minimum\n2\n4-FrameINDPrompt4-FrameOODPromptPLLaVAINDPromptPLLaVAOODPromptCounting\nTextLengthFigure 2: Histograms of generation text length distribution for 4-Frame and PLLaV A . x-axis are\ntext lengths, y-axis indicates the counting of text-lengths. 4-Frame generates shorter texts under\nmore training steps and the out-of-distribution prompt, while PLLaV A remains consistent in both\nsituations.\nspatial resolution of each frame that does not degrade the scaling curve. To achieve this, we adopt a\npooling [ 17] operation to explore the optimal settings such that it does not degrade the benefits of\nincreasing the temporal receptive field. The impact of the pooling operation is shown in Figure 7.\nFor the second observed phenomenon, we believe one main reason is the poor quality of the video\ndataset, compared to the image dataset. Specifically, many of the video datasets are in question-answer\nformats and the descriptions of the videos might be short. Thus, as the model learns the temporal\ndescription from the video dataset, the description of other metrics such as the objects and the spatial\nrelations degrades. the stronger the LLM is, the faster the output degrades. Instead of building\nhigh-quality video datasets, we choose to explore architectural and optimization algorithms to better\npreserve the learned information in image datasets during the learning of the temporal information on\nvideo datasets. To achieve this, we utilize the tricks of weight fusion. We set two groups of weights:\none from the image pre-raining and one with video dataset fine-tuning. After training, we searched to\nfind the optimal combination of the image-based model weights and the video-based model weights\nin the hope that the combined model could gather benefits from both datasets. The process is termed\npost-training optimization in this paper and its impacts are shown in Figure 5.\n\u2022We performed a thorough initial investigation for directly applying image large multi-\nmodality models to video tasks and found several failure modes. We then introduce an\nelegantly simple yet highly potent pooling strategy that systematically achieves the optimal\nbalance between training efficiency and caption accuracy.\n\u2022We introduce a post-training model merging method that could effectively reduce the\nforgetting phenomenon of the large language models during multi-modality fine-tuning.\nWith this, we are able to get a large video multi-modality model with 34B LLMs without\nthe extra creation of high-quality datasets.\n\u2022We conduct extensive experiments to verify the superiority of the proposed model and\nachieve a new state-of-the-art across various video understanding benchmarks, especially for\nvideo captioning tasks with dense captions.

Commonly, they incorporate a projection\nnetwork [ 33,25,21], inter-modality attention [ 19,20] or a modality perceiver [ 50,37,14] as learnable\ninterfaces. These interfaces are instrumental in melding the spatial-temporal dynamics of videos with\nlarge language models\u2019 (LLMs) processing capabilities [ 40,36,5], by transforming video content\ninto a sequence of tokens that LLMs can adeptly analyze. Parameter efficient learning schemes\n3\n[11,23,7] are adapted to reduce the computational cost. Among them, BLIP [ 18] marked a significant\nmilestone by integrating a frozen vision encoder with BLIP to enhance video processing efficiency,\nwith only the newly added Q-Former learnable. Demonstrating remarkable zero-shot capabilities in\nVideo Question Answering (VQA), it outperformed existing techniques of its time. Extending the\ninnovations of its predecessors, Video-ChatGPT [ 33] introduced the trailblazing approach of video\ninstruction tuning, along with creating a dataset of high-quality instructional data. This initiative set a\nnew standard for assessing models through video-based text generation benchmarks. VideoChat [ 19]\nemployed cross-attention mechanisms to skillfully condense video tokens, aligning user queries with\nthe dialogue context to enhance the model\u2019s interpretative capabilities. Building upon these advances,\nVideoChat2 [ 20] refined the approach with a multi-stage bootstrapping technique that honed in\non modality alignment and instruction tuning, amassing a robust collection of high-quality video\ndata for fine-tuning instruction-driven tasks. VILA [ 26] proposes more advanced training recipes.\nFurther integrating modalities, Video-LLaV A [ 25] leveraged a pre-aligned encoder adaptable to both\nimages and videos, facilitating shared projections and enabling synergistic training across image and\nvideo-related tasks. CAT [46] introduces both video and audio to futher enhance understanding.\nLong videos present significant challenges due to their intrinsic high computational complexity and\nextensive memory requirements. Handling the entire span of a long video with video tokens poses\ndifficulties in jointly capturing spatial details and temporal dynamics effectively. In response, Video\nLanguage Models (Video MLLMs) have adopted sophisticated temporal modeling techniques to\naddress these challenges with greater efficiency. MovieChat [ 37] implemented a novel memory-based\nmechanism within transformers, strategically combining similar frames to reduce both computational\nload and memory footprint. Chat-UniVi [ 14] debuted a harmonized approach for processing images\nand videos, innovatively condensing spatial and temporal tokens through dynamic token merging,\nutilizing k-NN algorithms for improved efficiency. LLaMA-VID [ 21] innovated with a dual-token\napproach that effectively condensed video representations by segregating context and content tokens,\nallowing for more efficient compression. VTimeLLM [ 12] emphasize the boundaries of videos\nby introducing a new question answering dataset. Advancing this innovation, Vista-LLaMA [ 32]\nintroduced EDVT-Attention along with a sequential vision projector that meticulously curates visual\ntokens and condenses temporal tokens, progressively amalgamating them with a Q-former mechanism.\nTo further optimize the handling of extended videos, certain models emphasized the selective\nprocessing of keyframes, thus diminishing the volume of video frames required and streamlining the\noverall computational demands.\nPipelined Video Understanding Capitalizing on the Video MLLM framework, a novel approach\nemerged involving the use of pre-existing Video Models coupled with LLMs through a multi-stage\nprocess of video modality conversion. This method entails translating video content into textual\nnarratives, typically through the employment of pretrained VideoLMs, before integrating with an\nLLM in the final phase. By encapsulating videos as text tokens, it leverages the LLMs\u2019 adeptness\nat navigating textual data, thereby permitting the interpretation of temporal sequences via these\ncrafted descriptions. VideoChat-Text [ 19] adeptly converts video streams into comprehensive text\ndescriptions, encapsulating a range of video elements. Meanwhile, LLoVi [ 49] unveiled an efficient,\nLLM-centric framework tailored for addressing queries that span long video durations. Here, video\ncaptioning agents transcribe videos into detailed textual descriptions which the LLMs then distill to\nenhance long-duration video comprehension. While the aforementioned methodologies primarily\ntranslate video into text for LLM processing, LLMs are concurrently being explored for their capacity\nto facilitate video analysis through program generation. ViperGPT [ 39] is a pioneering example,\nharnessing code-producing LLMs, including the likes of GPT-3 Codex [ 4]. It effectively utilizes a\nvisual module API catering to text-based queries and crafts programs that scrutinize image or video\ncontent, furnishing informed responses to those queries. Similarly, ProViQ [ 6] engages an LLM to\ncraft Python scripts that enact multi-stage procedural reasoning in the context of zero-shot video\nqueries, processing these scripts to ascertain solutions to posed questions.\n3 Method & Analysis\nAdapting image MLLMs into the video domain can be tricky and vulnerable to the designs of\nmodel structures.

We coined this method as n-frame . Specifically, given a sequence of video\nframesX\u2208RT\u00d7C\u00d7W\u00d7H, we obtain the features for each frame via the vision encoder pre-trained\nin CLIP-ViT [ 35] models and the encoded frames features are represented as Xv\u2208RT\u00d7w\u00d7h\u00d7d. The\nn-frame method is formulated as:\nr=MLLM (Xv, Xt), (1)\nwhere Xtis the text inputs and r is the output texts. Nonetheless, during our efforts to train the MLLM\nin this scenario, we encountered two issues that hindered us from achieving optimally performance\nmodels.\nVulnerability to prompts.

The first observation is that the models trained with n-frame could\nbe highly sensitive to prompt patterns when dealing with generation tasks. Figure 3 illustrates\nsuch a phenomenon. We divide the prompts into two categories: in-distribution (IND) and Out-of-\nDistribution (OOD). In the left part of the figure, when generating under the prompt pattern used in\ntraining (IND), the model can generate decent descriptions about the video despite its tendency of\nshorter generation length with more data samples trained. However, if we prompted the model with\nOOD prompts, in which we just changed the tags for the two roles in a conversation, the quality of\nthe generated response then drastically declined. The generation has content in normal length under\nthe model trained for 3750 steps. However, for the longer trained models, the generations are shorter\nfor 7500 steps, and even no response for 11250 steps.

Similar patterns are observed in the experimental findings of Video-\nChatGPT [ 33], as detailed in Table 1. Video-ChatGPT [ 33] introduces a unique pooling strategy that\ninvolves averaging visual features across the temporal dimension as well as the spatial dimension,\nresulting a visual feature Xvcg\u2208R(T+w\u00d7h)\u00d7dafter concatenating both dimensions.

The weights of the image LLMs are fused with LoRA weight\nlearned under video samples.\nMotivation Our initial attempts on n-frame and VideoChatGPT [ 33] reveal the intricacies of\nadapting image-focused MLLMs to the video domain, encountering the data scaling problem. The\nformer introduces a small amount of frames due to the limit of memory, whereas the latter compresses\nover 100 frames of information with pooling strategy. However, similar outcomes occur to both\nsituations.\nIn view of the necessity of temporal information and the prohibited costs of dealing with very long\nvideo input to MLLMs, pooling is an intuitive and simple way to fulfill both of the requirements. The\nabove two problems may stem from inadequacy of frame information and mishandling on the frame\nfeatures. Therefore, in this paper, we deeply look into the pooling strategies for video features used\nin MLLMs.\nDefinition We formalize the pooling process for video features as follows, a model structure is\nshown in Figure 6. After feeding video frames X\u2208RT\u00d7C\u00d7W\u00d7Hinto the CLIP-ViT model and\nthe multimodal projector, we obtain an encoded vision feature Xv\u2208RT\u00d7w\u00d7h\u00d7dfor a video input.\nThis feature is then passed through a parameter-free Adaptive Average Structure Pooling module and\nreduced to a smaller size.

Therefore, in this paper, we deeply look into the pooling strategies for video features used\nin MLLMs.\nDefinition We formalize the pooling process for video features as follows, a model structure is\nshown in Figure 6. After feeding video frames X\u2208RT\u00d7C\u00d7W\u00d7Hinto the CLIP-ViT model and\nthe multimodal projector, we obtain an encoded vision feature Xv\u2208RT\u00d7w\u00d7h\u00d7dfor a video input.\nThis feature is then passed through a parameter-free Adaptive Average Structure Pooling module and\nreduced to a smaller size.

(2)\nThese features are then concatenated with text input embeddings and fed into the LLM to generate\nresponses. We also include a LoRA [ 11] module to adapt the LLM to video-related generation tasks.\nIn conclusion, the trainable weights include Multimodal Projector and LLM LoRA.\nWithin this framework, we investigated the impact of pooling through grid search analysis. Our\nfindings suggest that pooling on the spatial dimension yields favorable outcomes, whereas temporal\ndimension pooling is associated with decreased performance. For a thorough exploration of our\nsearch process and the rationale behind this conclusion, please refer to Sec. 4.2.\n7\n3.4 Post Optimization\nRegarding the problem of performance decline associated with scaled model size, such degradation\nmay stem from diminished language proficiency resulting from training on low-quality video-text\ndata samples. To mitigate this, we propose a post-training optimization approach for the parameters\nof the video MLLM. It involves blending the trained Language Model (LLM) on video data with\nthe original LLM of the base image MLLM. For a pretrained MLLM with LLM parameters W0and\ngiven input Xvp, the output hidden states from the LoRA fine-tuned LLM can be acquired as follows:\nh=W0Xvp+\u03b1\nr\u2206WX vp, (3)\nwhere \u2206Ware a low-rank learnable parameters for adapting W0, and\u03b1\nris used to scale the learned\nlow-rank weight.\nAs part of our post-training optimization process, we tune the mix ratio between the original LLMs\nand the trained LLMs (incorporating LoRA weights) by varying the value of \u03b1during inference. Our\nexperiments indicate that lower \u03b1yields significantly better generative performance.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Experiment Setting\nData and Evaluation We leverage instructional video-to-text datasets to extend the capabilities\nof image MLLMs to handle video inputs. The training data are sourced from the dataset used in\nVideoChat2 [ 20], which embraces data for various video understanding tasks, including 27k conver-\nsation videos from VideoChat [ 19] and Video-ChatGPT [ 33], 80k data of classification tasks from\nKinetics [ 15] and SthSthV2 [ 8], 450k captioned data from Webvid [ 2], YouCook2 [ 52], TextVR [ 42]\nand VideoChat, 117 reasoning data from NextQA [ 43] and CLEVRER [ 47] and 109K annotated\nquestioning answering data samples from Webvid, TGIF [ 22] and Ego4D [ 9]. In total, we use 783k\ninstructional tuning data.\nWe evaluate our trained models with the following video-to-text benchmarks. First, the open-ended\nVideo Question Answer (VideoQA) includes MSVD-QA [ 44], MSRVTT-QA [ 44], ActivityQA [ 48],\nand TGIF QA [ 22]. Responses in these question-answering benchmarks typically consist of single-\nword answers. GPT-3.5 [ 34] is used to evaluate the accuracy (Accuracy, with answers true/false) and\nquality (Score, ranging from 0 to 5) of the models\u2019 responses. Additionally, we adopt the Video-based\nGenerative Performance benchmark (referred to as VCG Score), introduced by VideoChatGPT [ 33].\nThese benchmarks often involve longer answers, encompassing five aspects of video understanding:\nCI (Correctness of Information), DO (Detail Orientation), CU (Context Understanding), TU (Tem-\nporal Understanding), and CO (Consistency). The generation is also assessed using the GPT-3.5\nmodel. Furthermore, we also use the multi-choice Question Answering benchmark, MVBench [ 20],\ncomprising 20 tasks that demand nuanced temporal comprehension of videos. This benchmark does\nnot necessitate evaluation from the GPT-3.5 model.\nModels and Implementation Details PLLaV A is constructed upon the image MLLMs, LLaV A\nNext [ 29,28] models 7B, 13B, and 34B. We utilize their pre-trained weights available in the Hugging\nFace library1and integrate an average pooling to reduce feature dimensions before passing the input\nvisual features to the LLM generation component. For the pooling layer, we uniformly sample 16\nframes as input and set the target pooling shape to be 16\u00d712\u00d712\u00d7d, where dcorresponds to the\ninput dimension of the LLMs. During training, we employ a batch size of 128 and a learning rate of\n2e-5, with a cosine scheduler and a warmup ratio of 0.03. All the reported results are evaluated on\nmodels trained for 6250 steps. For evaluation, we adopt the GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 model across all the\nbenchmarks.\n4.2 Impact of Pooling Operation Design\nConsidering the unsatisfying performance of the complete pooling on temporal and spatial dimensions\nadopted in Video-ChatGPT and the limitation information in the straightforward n-frame method, we\nfurther explore the influence of poling strategies here.\n1https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/llava_next\n8\n1246812162024\nSpatial pooling shape343638404244MVBench\n35)(2,36.9)(4,39.8)(6,42.7)(8,44.6)(12,\n44.1)(16,\n43.1)(20,\n34.8)(1,44.3)(24,pooling (4,*,*)(a) Spatial shape effects on MVBench.\n1 2 4 812 16 20 24\nSpatial pooling shape1.82.02.22.42.62.8VCG\n1.77)(2,2.14)(4,2.66)(8,2.78)(16,2.78)(20, 2.78)(12,\n2.83)(24,\n1.76)(1,pooling(4,*,*) (b) Spatial shape effects on VCG.\n4 8 16 32 64\nTemporal input frames41424344MVBench\n44.6)(4,\n42.9)(8,\n41.9)(16,\n41.3)(32,41.4)(64,44.0)(8,\n42.7)(16,\n42.4)(32,42.6)(64,42.9)(16,\n42.1)(32,\n41.8)(64,pooling (4,12,12)\npooling (8,12,12)\npooling (16,12,12)\n(c) Temporal shape effects on MVBench.\n4 8 16 32 64\nTemporal input frames2.42.52.62.72.82.9VCG\n2.73)(4,\n2.7)(8,\n2.59)(16,\n2.49)(32,\n2.4)(64,2.85)(8,\n2.74)(16,\n2.62)(32,\n2.54)(64,2.87)(16,\n2.74)(32,\n2.63)(64,\npooling(4,12,12)\npooling(8,12,12)\npooling(16,12,12) (d) Temporal shape effects on VCG.\nFigure 7: Pooling shape influence.\nPooling Layer Design Pooling can be done both temporally and spatially. In this part, we aim to\nfigure out the answer to two questions: 1) which dimension is more suitable to be pooled to save the\ncomputational cost and 2) what is the largest compression ratio along that dimension. To achieve\nthis, we plot a model curve based on the LLaV A-1.5 7B model with different temporal and spatial\ndimensions controlled via pooling operation. Specifically, for the spatial dimension, we picked an\ninput video feature with shape (4,24,24, d), where 4 is the frame numbers (temporal dimension),\n24\u00d724 is the original spatial dimension of frame features, and dis the embedding dimension of\neach visual token. The target spatial shapes are chosen at evenly spaced intervals between 1 and 24,\nresulting in a set of spatial shapes S={n\u00d7n|n\u2208[1,2,4,6,8,12,16,20,24]}. The MVBench\nand VCG Score performance of these spatial pooling shapes are shown in Figure 7(a) and 7(b). It is\nobserved that downsampling the spatial dimension by 50% does not degrade the model performance.\nFurther reducing the spatial dimension would lead to a significant performance drop.

Considering the\ntradeoff between computational overhead and performance, 12 \u00d712 can be a target spatial dimension.\nWe further experimented on the temporal dimension. Several target pooling shapes were chosen with\nspatial dimensions fixed as 12, including (4,12,12), (8,12,12), and (16,12,12). We study the pooling\nperformance tendency when altering the number of input video frames, indicating the downsampling\nrate of poolings. For example, pooling from (64,24,24) to (4,12,12) indicates every 16 frames are\nfused, then the downsampling rate should be 6.25%. All of the resulting model curves are shown\nin Figure 7(c) and 7(d). Different from spatial pooling, the model performance is sensitive to the\ntemporal pooling. As illustrated in these two figures, all lines achieve better performance with lower\ndownsmapling rates. In other words, pooling along temporal dimension always downgrades the\nmodel performance.\nPooling Impact We found that pooling over more video frames not only improves the model\nefficiency but also makes the model more robust to user enquires. During our experiments, we\nevaluated models under different training iterations with two sets of prompts. For example, we vary\nthe role tag from \u2018USER\u2019 to \u2018Human\u2019 during evaluation and the results are as shown in Figure 3.\nThe figure shows that the visual feature norms learned with the pooling operation show consistent\ndistributions under different training iterations compared to the 4-frame method that shows dominant\n9\ntokens. This is also reflected in the model responses where the pooling method gives consistent good\ntext responses while the 4-frames method gives shorter and shorter text responses as the training\ngoes longer, or even no response when out-of-distribution prompts are used. This conclusion can be\nfurther validated by Figure 2. With pooling introduced, no matter what prompt is used or how much\ntraining sampled is learned, the text generation lengths with the pooling method are consistent. We\nowe the stability in generation to the smoothing ability of pooling, which eliminates the influence of\ndominant high norm tokens.

In Sec.4.2, we have illustrated the impact of temporal and spatial\npoolings, concluding that pooling along the temporal dimension consistently results in decreased\nperformance compared to retaining the original frame numbers. We attribute this phenomenon to the\ninterference with token features. In image MLLMs, features are derived from images/video frames\nusing CLiP-ViT models, which produce embedded patches for each image/video frame, resulting in a\nvideo feature with shape (T, H, W ). Pooling changes the dimensions of T(time), H(height), and W\n(weight). In contrast to pooling along the spatial dimension (local pooling on single images/frames,\nchanging HandW), pooling along the temporal dimension (changing T) risks altering the original\nframe features. To validate the guess, we visualize token similarities among spatial and temporal\ntoken neighbors for a video feature in Figure 8. The two subfigures reveal significantly higher\nsimilarities within spatial neighbors than temporal neighbors. This observation supports the potential\ndistortion of original token features caused by temporal pooling. LLMs are designed for sequence\nunderstanding. Even without preprocessing on temporal information aggregation, they can model\ntemporal relations.\nImage? Video? or Both? Post-training optimization is defined as the combination of the LLMs\u2019\nparameters of image MLLMs and learned LLMs\u2019 LoRA weights from video samples.

Here, we discuss the influence of different choices of fusion ratio on the\nunderstanding performance. As shown in Figure 9, the x-axis represents the alpha value of LoRA.\n0 indicates no LoRA weights added, and 32 means the LoRA weights are fully applied to LLMs.\nWe observed distinct trends between MVBench and VCG Score. The former exhibits a peak around\nalpha 20, while the latter performs best near alpha 4. This variance can be attributed to the nature\nof these two benchmarks: VCG typically involves longer length generations, whereas MVBench\nfocuses on multiple-choice question answering, placing less emphasis on language generation ability.\nConsequently, weights learned from video-text data samples are more tailored for MVBench tasks.\nIn this way, a larger portion of video weights are beneficial for MVBench. Moreover, from these two\nfigures, it\u2019s evident that combining video and image weights leads to better performance than at the\nextremes of 0 and 32.\n4.5 Case Studies\nApart from these quantitative results, we also qualitatively investigate the video understanding abilities\nof PLLaV A models. We have shown several caption examples in Figure 10. According to the video\nclips, compared to IG-VLM, PLLaV A 34B recognizes more details about videos, including the\nclothes worn by the main characters, the environment, and even some of the words in this video.\nBesides, as shown in Figure 10(b), PLLaV A can understand the video content more correctly, in\nwhich people are playing badminton rather than volleyball. These mistakes made by IG-VLM could\nbe caused by the lowered resolution when concatenating frames into the grid view in the method\ndesign. Pooling reduces dimension after frames are encoded, thus leading to less information loss.\n4.6 Dense Recaption\nIn view of the caption ability of PLLaV A , we further tested its recaption task and contributed 1K\nvideo Inter4K [ 38] caption dataset. An example is shown in Figure 11. Compared to Open-Sora\nGPT-4 pipeline, our model captures better caption details and also highlights motion information in\nthe video, demonstrate PLLaV A \u2019s potential to contribute to the video generation community.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we conduct an initial investigation for extending image-language models to videos\nwith a simple", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 6193, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db3e63f1-453b-4fc0-acea-4e11d84540e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "db3e63f1-453b-4fc0-acea-4e11d84540e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "txt/2404.16994v2.txt", "file_name": "2404.16994v2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 60215, "creation_date": "04/2024", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17", "prev_section_summary": "The section discusses the adaptation and enhancement of image-based Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for video understanding, specifically through the PLLaV A model.

Our method can effectively increase\nthe log-likelihood of the chosen response and decrease that of the rejected response, which cannot\nbe trivially achieved by symmetric pairwise loss such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\nand Identity Preference Optimization (IPO). In our experiments, using only 60k prompts (without\nresponses) from the UltraFeedback dataset and without any prompt augmentation, by leveraging\na pre-trained preference model PairRM with only 0.4B parameters, SPPO can obtain a model\nfrom fine-tuning Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 that achieves the state-of-the-art length-controlled\nwin-rate of 28.53% against GPT-4-Turbo on AlpacaEval 2.0. It also outperforms the (iterative)\nDPO and IPO on MT-Bench and the Open LLM Leaderboard. Notably, the strong performance\nof SPPO is achieved without additional external supervision (e.g., responses, preferences, etc.)\nfrom GPT-4 or other stronger language models.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI et al., 2023), have shown\nremarkable capabilities in producing human-like text, fielding questions, and coding.

To address these challenges, Reinforcement Learning from Human\nFeedback (RLHF), also known as Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL), presents a\npromising solution. This framework for policy optimization, highlighted in works by Christiano et al.\n(2017) and recently in Ouyang et al. (2022), has led to significant empirical success in fine-tuning\ninstruction-following LLMs, making them more aligned with human preferences and thus more\nhelpful.\nMost existing approaches to RLHF rely on either explicit or implicit reward models. Taking\nInstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) as an example, a reference policy \u03c0refis first established,\ntypically from supervised pre-training or instruction-based (supervised) fine-tuning. An explicit\nreward function is obtained by training a reward model based on human preference feedback data,\nemploying the Bradley-Terry (BT) model (Bradley and Terry, 1952). Subsequently, reinforcement\nlearning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (Schulman et al., 2017, PPO) are used to\nfine-tune the reference LLM \u03c0refby maximizing the expected reward function. The reward model\nprovides a \u201creward score\u201d r(y;x) for the given response yand prompt x, approximately reflecting\nhow humans value these responses. More recently, methods like Direct Preference Optimization\n(Rafailov et al., 2024, DPO) have been introduced. These methods forgo the training of a separate\nreward model, instead using the log-likelihood ratio to implicitly represent the reward score, which\nis then integrated into the same Bradley-Terry model to directly optimize the LLM. Nonetheless,\nboth the two-step RLHF algorithms and the one-step direct preference fundamentally adhere to the\nreward maximization objective and are determined by parametric models such as the BT model.\nParametric preference models such as the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley and Terry, 1952) and\nthe Thurstone model (Thurstone, 1927) provide reasonable approximations of human preferences,\nyet they fall short of fully capturing the complexity of human behavior. These models presuppose a\nmonotonous and transitive relationship among preferences for different choices. However, empirical\nevidence suggests otherwise. For instance, Tversky (1969) observed human decisions can be\ninfluenced by different factors and exhibit inconsistency. Such observations indicate that human\npreferences do not always adhere to a single, value-based hierarchy and can even appear irrational,\nsuch as exhibiting loops in preference relations. For LLMs, another motivating evidence is that\nMunos et al. (2023) has empirically shown that directly predicting the pairwise preference can\nachieve higher accuracy than predicting the preference via a BT-based reward model.\nTo address the inconsistency in human preference, researchers have proposed to work directly\nwith the preference probability and design algorithms that can more flexibly represent human\npreferences (Lou et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023) in the ranking or bandit setting. Recently, an\nemerging line of work (Munos et al., 2023; Swamy et al., 2024) also proposed to study RLHF\nfor LLMs under such general preference P(y\u227by\u2032|x), where yandy\u2032are two different responses\nandxis the prompt. Munos et al. (2023) formulated RLHF as finding the Nash equilibrium of a\n(Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence-regularized) two-player constant-sum game where each player\nis an LLM that outputs responses and aims to maximize its probability of being preferred over\nits opponent, where the preference P(y\u227by\u2032|x) is assumed given by an external source, such as\nhuman annotators or a strong language model. They proposed to approximate the Nash equilibrium\nusing an on-policy mirror descent algorithm. Very recently, Swamy et al. (2024) proposed Self-play\nPreference Optimization (SPO) for the same (unregularized) two-player constant-sum game. Their\nalgorithm is designed to identify the mini-maximal optimal policy (i.e., the Nash equilibrium policy)\nby iteratively fine-tuning the policy based on the data generated from the policy of the last iteration.\n2\nDifferent from our work, they focus on the Markov decision process (MDP) in simple robotic or\ngame tasks and employ typical policy optimization algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization\n(PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) or Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) (Haarnoja et al., 2018). It remains\nunclear how their self-play framework can be applied to LLM alignment. More recently, Rosset et al.\n(2024) proposed the Direct Nash Optimization (DNO) algorithm based on the cross-entropy between\ntrue and predicted win rate gaps. However, their practical version still utilizes the iterative-DPO\nframework as in Xu et al. (2023) which is not covered in their theoretical analysis.\nIn this paper, motivated by these observations, we propose a new self-play framework that (1)\nenjoys provable guarantees to solve the two-player constant-sum game; and (2) can scale up to\nlarge-scale efficient fine-tuning of large language models. In detail, we formulate the RLHF problem\nas a constant-sum two-player game. Our objective is to identify the Nash equilibrium policy, which\nconsistently provides preferred responses over any other policy on average. To identify the Nash\nequilibrium policy approximately, we adopt the classic online adaptive algorithm with multiplicative\nweights (Freund and Schapire, 1999) as a high-level framework that solves the two-player game.\nFurther, each step of the high-level framework can be approximated by a self-play mechanism, where\nin each round the policy is playing against itself in the previous round by fine-tuning it on synthetic\ndata that are generated by the policy and annotated by the preference model.\nOur contributions are highlighted as follows:\n\u2022Starting from the exponential weight update algorithm which provably converges to the\nNash equilibrium of the two-player constant-sum game, we propose the Self-Play Preference\nOptimization (SPPO) algorithm for large language model alignment.

Additionally, SPPO exhibits strong\ngeneralist abilities across different tasks, including MT-Bench, the Open LLM Leaderboard,\nand the PairRM score (Jiang et al., 2023b). Unlike iterative DPO/IPO, which tends to show\nperformance decay on other benchmarks when optimized towards the PairRM score, SPPO\u2019s\nperformance gain is consistent. Notably, all the strong performances are achieved without\nexternal supervision (e.g., responses, preferences, etc.) from GPT-4 or other stronger language\nmodels. Despite using only the 60k prompts (without responses) from the UltraFeedback\ndataset (Cui et al., 2023) and forgoing any prompt augmentation, our method achieves\nperformance comparable to GPT-4 on the AlpacaEval 2.0 win-rate.\n3\n2 Related Work\nRLHF with Explicit/Implicit Reward Model Originally, reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF) was proposed by Christiano et al. (2017) as a methodology that first learns a reward\nmodel reflecting human preferences and then uses reinforcement learning algorithms to maximize\nthe reward. This methodology is applied by Ouyang et al. (2022) to fine-tune instruction-following\nlarge language models and leads to the popular ChatGPT.\nThe reward model in the works mentioned above assumes a parametric model such as the\nBradley-Terry model (Bradley and Terry, 1952), which assigns a \u201cscore\u201d representing how preferred\na given response is. More recently, Rafailov et al. (2024) proposed to instead directly solve the closed-\nform solution of such a score implied by the Bradley-Terry model. The Direct Policy Optimization\n(DPO) method is claimed to be more efficient and stable, yet, still implicitly assumes such a reward\nmodel that specifies the \u201cscore\u201d. In a similar spirit, Zhao et al. (2023) proposed to calibrate the\nscore so that the score of the winner in comparison has a margin over the score of the loser, and\ninduces a different SLic loss. Similarly, Ethayarajh et al. (2024) derived a different loss function\n(called KTO) from the Kahneman-Tversky human utility function, which implicitly denotes a score\nof the given response. Liu et al. (2023) proposed Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO) which\nutilizes a preference model to generate preference pairs with candidates sampled from the optimal\npolicy; then preference optimization is applied on the sampled preference pairs. Hong et al. (2024)\nproposed Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) algorithm that can perform supervised\nfine-tuning and preference alignment in one training session without maintaining an intermediate\nreference policy.\nRLHF with General Preference Model Often, the human preference is not strictly transitive,\nand cannot be sufficiently represented by a single numerical score. Azar et al. (2023) proposed a\ngeneral preference optimization objective based on the preference probability between a pair of\nresponses instead of a score of a single response. They further propose a learning objective based on\nidentity mapping of the preference probability called IPO (Preference Optimization with Identity\nmapping), which aims to maximize the current policy\u2019s expected winning probability over a given\nreference policy. Munos et al. (2023) formulated the RLHF problem with general preference as a\ntwo-player, constant-sum game, where each player is one policy that aims to maximize the probability\nof its response being preferred against its opponent. They aim to identify the Nash equilibrium policy\nof this game and propose a mirror-descent algorithm that guarantees the last-iterate convergence of\na policy with tabular representations1. Swamy et al. (2024) studied the two-player constant-sum\ngame without KL regularization and proposed Self-Play Preference Optimization (SPO), an RLHF\nframework similar to our framework in this paper. The framework is the same as ours in the idealized\ncase where the exponential weight update is utilized. Different from our work, they focus on the\nmulti-round Markov decision process (MDP) in robotic or game tasks rather than in fine-tuning\nlarge language models. More recently, Rosset et al. (2024) proposed the Direct Nash Optimization\n(DNO) algorithm based on the cross-entropy between true and predicted win rate gaps, and provided\ntheoretical guarantees on the error of finite-sample approximations. However, their practical version\nstill utilizes the iterative-DPO framework as in Xu et al. (2023) with the DPO loss instead of their\nown DNO loss. Notably, in their experiments, they added the GPT-4 generated responses as their\n1Due to the tabular representation, computing the normalizing factor is prohibitive and the algorithm is approxi-\nmately executed by sampling one token instead of a full response.\n4\n\u201cgold sample\u201d into their fine-tuning data, and used GPT-4 as a judge to assign a numerical score to\neach response for preference pair construction. In sharp contrast, our work does not require use any\nstrong external supervision besides a small-sized reward model.\nSelf-Play Fine-Tuning Most works mentioned above (Rafailov et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2023;\nAzar et al., 2023; Ethayarajh et al., 2024) consider one single optimization procedure starting from\nsome reference policy. The same procedure may be applied repeatedly for multiple rounds in a\nself-play manner. In each round, new data are generated by the policy obtained in the last round;\nthese new data are then used for training a new policy that can outperform the old policy.\nThe self-play fine-tuning can be applied to both scenarios with or without human preference\ndata. For example, Singh et al. (2023) proposed an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework\nwhere in each round, new data are generated and annotated with a reward score; the new policy is\nobtained by fine-tuning the policy on the data with a high reward. Chen et al. (2024) proposed\na self-play framework to fine-tune the model in a supervised way. In each round, new preference\npairs are synthesized by labeling the policy-generated responses as losers and the human-generated\nresponses as winners. Then DPO is applied in each round to fine-tune another policy based on\nthese synthesized preference data. Yuan et al. (2024) proposed Self-Rewarding Language Models,\nwhere the language model itself is used to annotate preference on its own responses. Iterative\nDPO is applied to fine-tune language models on these annotated data. These works show iterative\nfine-tuning can significantly improve the performance.\nTheory of RLHF There is also a line of research to analyze RLHF and provide its theoretical\nguarantees. Zhu et al. (2023) studied the standard RLHF with separate reward-learning and\nmodel-tuning and proposed a pessimistic reward-learning process that provably learns a linear\nreward model. Wang et al. (2024) proposed a framework to reduce any RLHF problem with a\nreward model to a reward-based standard RL problem. Additionally, they proposed to identify the\nNash equilibrium policy when a general preference model is present and show that the problem\ncan be reduced to a two-player zero-sum Markov game. Xiong et al. (2023) studied the reverse-KL\nregularized contextual bandit for RLHF in different settings and proposed efficient algorithms with\nfinite-sample theoretical guarantees. Ye et al. (2024) studied the theoretical learnability of the\nKL-regularized Nash-Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF) by considering both offline and online\nsettings and proposed provably efficient algorithms.

Additionally, they proposed to identify the\nNash equilibrium policy when a general preference model is present and show that the problem\ncan be reduced to a two-player zero-sum Markov game.

Given a text sequence (commonly referred\nto as prompt) x= [x1, x2, . . .], two text sequences y= [y1, y2, . . .] and y\u2032are generated as responses\nto the prompt x.

We denote P(y\u227by\u2032|x) =E[o(y\u227by\u2032|x)] as the probability of y\u201cwinning the\nduel\u201d over y\u2032. The KL divergence of two probability distributions of density pandqis defined as\nKL(p\u2225q) =Ey\u223cp(y)h\nlogp(y)\nq(y)i\n.\n3.1 RLHF with Reward Models\nChristiano et al. (2017) first learn a reward function r(y;x) following the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley\nand Terry, 1952). For a prompt-response-response triplet ( x,y,y\u2032), the Bradley-Terry model specifies\nthe probability of ybeing chosen over yas\nP(y\u227by\u2032|x) =exp(r(y;x))\nexp(r(y;x)) + exp( r(y\u2032;x))=\u03c3\u0000\nr(y;x)\u2212r(y\u2032;x)\u0001\n, (3.1)\nwhere \u03c3(x) =ex/(ex+ 1) is the logistic function. The reward function associated with the Bradley-\nTerry model can be estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood logP(y\u227by\u2032|x). Suppose the\ntrue reward function r(y;x)) is available, Christiano et al. (2017) proposed to solve the following\noptimization problem with policy optimization algorithms in RL such as PPO (Schulman et al.,\n2017):\nmax\n\u03b8Ex\u223cX,y\u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|x)[r(y;x)]\u2212\u03b7\u22121Ex\u223cX[KL(\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|x)\u2225\u03c0ref(\u00b7|x))], (3.2)\nwhere Xis the prompt distribution.\nRafailov et al.

(2024); Munos et al. (2023), we aim to establish RLHF methods without\na reward/utility model, as the human preference can be non-transitive (Tversky, 1969). Under\na general preference oracle P(y\u227by\u2032|x), we follow Dud\u00b4 \u0131k et al. (2015) and aim to identify the\nvon Neumann winner . More specifically, the von Neumann winner \u03c0\u2217is the (symmetric) Nash\nequilibrium of the following two-player constant-sum game:\n(\u03c0\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) = arg max\n\u03c0min\n\u03c0\u2032Ex\u223cXh\nEy\u223c\u03c0(\u00b7|x),y\u2032\u223c\u03c0(\u00b7|x)\u0002\nP(y\u227by\u2032|x)\u0003i\n. (3.3)\nIn addition, we define the winning probability of one response yagainst a distribution of responses\n\u03c0as\nP(y\u227b\u03c0|x) =Ey\u2032\u223c\u03c0(\u00b7|x)[P(y\u227by\u2032|x)],\n6\nand the winning probability of one policy \u03c0against another policy \u03c0\u2032as\nP(\u03c0\u227b\u03c0\u2032|x) =Ey\u223c\u03c0(\u00b7|x)Ey\u2032\u223c\u03c0\u2032(\u00b7|x)[P(y\u227by\u2032|x)].\nFurthermore, we define P(\u03c0\u227b\u03c0\u2032) =Ex\u223cX[P(\u03c0\u227b\u03c0\u2032|x)], where xis a prompt drawn from the\nprompt distribution X. One may notice that P(y\u2032\u227by|x) = 1\u2212P(y\u227by\u2032|x) due to the symmetry\nof the preference oracle and thus P(\u03c0\u227b\u03c0\u2032) +P(\u03c0\u2032\u227b\u03c0) = 1. The two-player constant-sum game\n(3.3) can be simplified as\n(\u03c0\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) = arg max\n\u03c0min\n\u03c0\u2032P(\u03c0\u227b\u03c0\u2032).\n4 Self-Play Preference Optimization (SPPO)\nIn this section, we introduce the Self-Play Preference Optimization (SPPO) algorithm, derived from\nthe following theoretical framework.\n4.1 Theoretical Framework\nThere are well-known algorithms to approximately solve the Nash equilibrium in a constant-sum\ntwo-player game. In this work, we follow Freund and Schapire (1999) to establish an iterative\nframework that can asymptotically converge to the optimal policy on average. We start with a\ntheoretical framework that conceptually solves the two-player game as follows:\n\u03c0t+1(y|x)\u221d\u03c0t(y|x) exp( \u03b7P(y\u227b\u03c0t|x)),fort= 1,2, . . . . (4.1)\n(4.1) is an iterative framework that relies on the multiplicative weight update in each round tand\nenjoys a clear structure. Initially, we have a base policy \u03c01usually from some supervised fine-tuned\nmodel. In each round, the updated policy \u03c0t+1is obtained from the reference policy \u03c0tfollowing\nthe multiplicative weight update. More specifically, a response yshould have a higher probability\nweight if it has a higher average advantage over the current policy \u03c0t.\nEquivalently, (4.1) can be written as\n\u03c0t+1(y|x) =\u03c0t(y|x) exp\u0000\n\u03b7P(y\u227b\u03c0t|x)\u0001\nZ\u03c0t(x), (4.2)\nwhere Z\u03c0t(x) =P\ny\u03c0t(y|x)exp\u0000\n\u03b7P(y\u227b\u03c0t|x)\u0001\nis the normalizing factor (a.k.a., the partition\nfunction). For any fixed xandy, the ideal update policy \u03c0t+1should satisfy the following equation:\nlog\u0012\u03c0t+1(y|x)\n\u03c0t(y|x)\u0013\n=\u03b7\u00b7P(y\u227b\u03c0t|x)\u2212logZ\u03c0t(x). (4.3)\nUnlike the pair-wise design in DPO or IPO that cancels the log normalizing factor logZ\u03c0t(x) by\ndifferentiating (4.3) between yandy\u2032, we choose to approximate (4.3) directly in terms of L2\ndistance:\n\u03c0t+1= argmin\n\u03c0Ex\u223cX,y\u223c\u03c0t(\u00b7|x)\u0012\nlog\u0012\u03c0(y|x)\n\u03c0t(y|x)\u0013\n\u2212\u0010\n\u03b7P(y\u227b\u03c0t|x)\u2212logZ\u03c0t(x)\u0011\u00132\n. (4.4)\n7\nEstimation of the Probability The optimization objective (4.4) can be approximated with finite\nsamples. We choose to sample Kresponses y1,y2, . . . ,yK\u223c\u03c0t(\u00b7|x) for each prompt x, and denote\nthe empirical distribution by b\u03c0K\nt. The finite-sample optimization problem can be approximated as\n\u03c0t+1= argmin\n\u03c0Ex\u223cX,y\u223c\u03c0t(\u00b7|x)\u0012\nlog\u0012\u03c0(y|x)\n\u03c0t(y|x)\u0013\n\u2212\u0010\n\u03b7P(y\u227bb\u03c0K\nt|x)\u2212logZb\u03c0K\nt(x)\u0011\u00132\n.

For completeness, we include the proof in\nAppendix A.\nAlternatively, we can avoid estimating logZb\u03c0K\nt(x) by replacing it simply with \u03b7/22in(4.5) to\nobtain a more clear objective:\n\u03c0t+1= argmin\n\u03c0Ex\u223cX,y\u223c\u03c0t(\u00b7|x)\u0012\nlog\u0012\u03c0(y|x)\n\u03c0t(y|x)\u0013\n\u2212\u03b7\u0012\nP(y\u227bb\u03c0K\nt|x)\u22121\n2\u0013\u00132\n. (4.6)\nIntuitively, if a tie occurs (i.e., P(y\u227bb\u03c0K\nt|x) = 1 /2), we prefer the model does not update weight\naty. Ifywins over b\u03c0K\nton average (i.e., P(y\u227bb\u03c0K\nt|x)>1/2), then we increase the probability\ndensity at yto employ the advantage of yoverb\u03c0K\nt. In our experiments, we choose to minimize the\nobjective (4.6).\n4.2 The SPPO Algorithm\nBased on the aformentioned theoretical framework, we propose the Self-Play Preference Optimization\nalgorithm in Algorithm 1. In each round t, Algorithm 1 will first generate Kresponses y1,y2, . . . ,yK\naccording to \u03c0t(\u00b7|x) for each prompt x(Line 3). Then, the preference oracle Pwill be queried\nto calculate the win rate among the Kresponses (Line 4). At Line 5, certain criteria can be\napplied to determine which response should be kept in the constructed dataset Dtand construct\nthe prompt-response-probability triplet ( x,y,bP(y\u227b\u03c0t|x)). We will discuss the design choices later\nin Section 5. One straightforward design choice is to include all Kresponses into Dtand each\nbP(yi\u227b\u03c0t|x) is estimated by comparing yito all Kresponses. In total, O(K2) queries will be made.\nThen the algorithm will optimize (4.6) on the dataset Dt(Line 6).\n2Assuming the winning probability between any pair is a fair coin toss, when K\u2192 \u221e , we can show that indeed\nZb\u03c0K\nt(x)\u2192e\u03b7/2.\n8\nAlgorithm 1 Self-Play Preference Optimization (SPPO)\n1:input : base policy \u03c0\u03b81, preference oracle P, learning rate \u03b7, number of generated samples K.\n2:fort= 1,2, . . .do\n3: Generate synthetic responses by sampling x\u223c X andy1:K\u223c\u03c0t(\u00b7|x).\n4: Annotate the win-rate P(yk\u227byk\u2032|x),\u2200k, k\u2032\u2208[K].\n5: Select responses from y1:Kto form dataset Dt={(xi,yi,bP(yi\u227b\u03c0t|xi))}i\u2208[N].\n6: Optimize \u03c0\u03b8t+1according to (4.6):\n\u03b8t+1\u2190argmin\n\u03b8E(x,y,bP(y\u227b\u03c0t|x))\u223cDt\u0012\nlog\u0012\u03c0\u03b8(y|x)\n\u03c0t(y|x)\u0013\n\u2212\u03b7\u0012\nbP(y\u227b\u03c0t|x)\u22121\n2\u0013\u00132\n. (4.7)\n7:end for\nComparison with DPO, IPO, and KTO In practice, we utilize mini-batches of more than\n2 responses to estimate the win rate of a given response, while the DPO and IPO loss focus on a\nsingle pair of responses. When only a pair of responses ywandylis available, we have the pair-wise\nsymmetric loss based on the preference triplet ( x,yw,yl) defined as:\n\u2113SPPO (x,yw,yl;\u03b8;\u03c0ref) :=\u0012\nlog\u0012\u03c0\u03b8(yw|x)\n\u03c0ref(yw|x)\u0013\n\u2212\u03b7\u0010\nP(yw\u227byl|x)\u22121\n2\u0011\u00132\n+\u0012\nlog\u0012\u03c0\u03b8(yl|x)\n\u03c0ref(yl|x)\u0013\n\u2212\u03b7\u0010\nP(yw\u227ayl|x)\u22121\n2\u0011\u00132\n, (4.8)\nwhere P(yw\u227byl|x) can be either a soft probability within [0 ,1] or a hard label 1 indicating yw\u227byl.\nWe now compare the SPPO loss to other baselines. For the ease of comparison, let\na=\u03b2log\u0012\u03c0\u03b8(yw|x)\n\u03c0ref(yw|x)\u0013\n, b=\u03b2log\u0012\u03c0\u03b8(yl|x)\n\u03c0ref(yl|x)\u0013\n, c=\u03b2KL(\u03c0\u03b8\u2225\u03c0ref),\nthen we have\n\u2113DPO(yw,yl,x) =\u2212log\u03c3(a\u2212b), (4.9)\n\u2113IPO(yw,yl,x) = [( a\u2212b)\u22121]2, (4.10)\n\u2113KTO(yw,yl,x) =\u03c3(\u2212a+c) +\u03c3(b\u2212c) (simplified) , (4.11)\nwhere \u03c3(x) =ex/(ex+ 1) and the SPPO loss can be written as\n\u2113SPPO(yw,yl,x) = (a\u22121/2)2+ (b+ 1/2)2.\nIt can be seen that SPPO not only pushes the gap between aandbto be 1, but also attempts to push\nvalue of ato be close to 1 /2 and the value of bto be close to \u22121/2 such that \u03c0\u03b8(yw|x)> \u03c0 ref(yw|x)\nand\u03c0\u03b8(yl|x)< \u03c0 ref(yl|x). We believe this is particularly important: when there are plenty of\npreference pairs, DPO and IPO can ensure the policy will converge to the target policy, but when\nthe preference pairs are scarce (e.g., one pair for each prompt), there is no guarantee that the\nestimated reward of the winner awill increase and the estimated reward of the loser bwill decrease.\nInstead, only the reward gap between the winner and the loser (i.e., a\u2212b) will increase. This\n9\nphenomenon is observed by Pal et al. (2024) that DPO only drives the loser\u2019s likelihood to be small,\nbut the winner\u2019s likelihood barely changes. We believe that fitting \u03b2log\u0010\n\u03c0t+1(y|x)\n\u03c0t(y|x)\u0011\ndirectly to\nP(y\u227b\u03c0t|x)\u22121/2 is more direct than IPO which attempts to fit \u03b2log\u0010\n\u03c0t+1(yw|x)\n\u03c0t(yw|x)\u0011\n\u2212\u03b2log\u0010\n\u03c0t+1(yl|x)\n\u03c0t(yl|x)\u0011\ntoP(yw\u227b\u03c0t|x)\u2212P(yl\u227b\u03c0t|x). In addition, SPPO shares a similar spirit as KTO. The KTO loss\npushes ato be large by minimizing \u03c3(\u2212a+c) and pushes bto be small by minimizing \u03c3(b\u2212c). In\ncontrast, SPPO pushes ato be as large as 1 /2 and bto be as small as \u22121/2.\nOn the other", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5551, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "116ecb86-fd59-475f-ba3b-038ca549948c": {"__data__": {"id_": "116ecb86-fd59-475f-ba3b-038ca549948c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "txt/2405.00675v1.txt", "file_name": "2405.00675v1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67475, "creation_date": "05/2024", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17", "prev_section_summary": "The section discusses a method for estimating the probability of optimization objectives in machine learning, specifically through the use of empirical distributions and finite-sample approximations.

In contrast, SPPO and IPO are by design\ncapable to solve the Nash equilibrium iteratively. SPPO is superior to IPO because its design\nexplicitly alleviates the data sparsity issue, as discussed above.\n5 Experiments\nWe conduct extensive experiments to show the performance of our method and compare it with\nother baselines.\n5.1 Experiment Setup\nBase Model and Datasets We follow the experimental setup of Snorkel3, a model that utilizes\niterative DPO to achieve state-of-the-art performance on AlpacaEval benchmarks. Specifically,\nwe use Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 as our base model4. Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 is an instruction\nfine-tuned version of Mistral-7B-v0.2 model (Jiang et al., 2023a). We also adopt Ultrafeedback (Cui\net al., 2023) as our source of prompts which includes around 60k prompts from diverse resources.\nDuring generation, we follow the standard chat template of Mistral-7B. In order to avoid overfitting\nduring the fine-tuning, we split the dataset into three portions and use only one portion per iteration.\nThese settings were also adopted by training the model Snorkel-Mistral-PairRM-DPO5(Snorkel).\nWe follow the splitting in Snorkel for a fair comparison.\nPreference Model We employ PairRM (Jiang et al., 2023b), an efficient pair-wise preference\nmodel of size 0.4B. PairRM is based on DeBERTA-V3 (He et al., 2021) and trained on high-quality\nhuman-preference datasets. Results on benchmarks like Auto-J Pairwise dataset (Li et al., 2023a)\nshow that it outperforms most of the language-model-based reward models and performs comparably\nwith larger reward models like UltraRM-13B (Cui et al., 2023). We refer the readers to the homepage\non Huggingface6for detailed benchmark results. We therefore keep PairRM as our ranking model\nfollowing Snorkel for a balance between accuracy and efficiency.\nSpecifically, PairRM will output a \u201crelative reward\u201d s(y,y\u2032;x) that reflects the strength difference\nbetween yandy\u2032, i.e.,\nP(y\u227by\u2032|x) =exp(s(y,y\u2032;x))\n1 + exp( s(y,y\u2032;x)).\n3https://huggingface.co/snorkelai/Snorkel-Mistral-PairRM-DPO\n4https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\n5https://huggingface.co/snorkelai/Snorkel-Mistral-PairRM-DPO\n6https://huggingface.co/llm-blender/PairRM\n10\nUnlike the Bradley-Terry-based reward model, PairRM only assigns the relative reward which is not\nguaranteed to be transitive (i.e., s(y1,y2;x) +s(y2,y3;x)\u0338=s(y1,y3;x)). So it indeed models the\ngeneral preference.\nResponse Generation and Selection During the generation phase in each iteration, we use top\np= 1.0 and temperature 1 .0 to sample from the current policy. We sample with different random\nseeds to get K= 5 different responses for each prompt. Previous works utilizing Iterative DPO\nchoose 2 responses to form a pair for each prompt. For a fair comparison, we do not include all\nK= 5 responses in the preference data but choose two responses among them. Following Snorkel,\nwe choose the winner ywand loser ylto be the response with the highest andlowest PairRM score,\nwhich is defined for each response yias:\nsPairRM (yi;x) :=1\nKKX\nk=1s(yi,yk;x).\nProbability Estimation We then estimate the win rate over the distribution by the average win\nrate over all the sampled responses as explained in (4.5):\nbP(yi\u227b\u03c0t|xi) =1\nKKX\nk=1P(yi\u227byk|x),\u2200i\u2208[K].\nHyperparameter Tuning The experiments are conducted on 8 \u00d7Nvidia A100 GPUs. For\nSPPO, we trained three iterations in total. In each iteration, we selected the model that was trained\non the first epoch of the 20k prompts from UltraFeedback to proceed to the next iteration. The\nglobal training batch size is set to 64 and \u03b7is set to 1 e3. The learning rate schedule is determined by\nthe following hyperparameters: learning rate=5.0e-7, number of total training epochs=18, warmup\nratio=0.1, linear schedule. The best hyper-parameters for each model is selected by the average\nwin-rate (judged by PairRM-0.4B) on a hold-out subset of Ultrafeedback as the metric. For more\ndetails on the win-rate comparison using PairRM as a judge, please refer to Section 5.2 and Figure 3.\nBaselines We evaluate the following base models as well as baseline methods for fine-tuning\nLLMs:\n\u2022Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 is an instruction fine-tuned version of\nMistral-7B-v0.2 model (Jiang et al., 2023a). It is the starting point of our algorithm.\n\u2022Snorkel (Mistral-PairRM-DPO): We directly evaluate the uploaded checkpoint on Hugging-\nFace7. This model is obtained by three rounds of iterative DPO from Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.\n\u2022(Iterative) DPO: We also implement the iterative DPO algorithm by ourselves. The experi-\nmental settings and model selection schemes align with those used for SPPO, except for the\nadoption of the DPO loss function as defined in (4.9). Hyperparameters are optimized to\nmaximize the average win-rate assessed by PairRM at each iteration. Note that the practical\nalgorithm in Rosset et al. (2024) is essentially the same as iterative DPO.\n7https://huggingface.co/snorkelai/Snorkel-Mistral-PairRM-DPO\n11\n\u2022(Iterative) IPO: We implement the iterative IPO algorithm by ourselves. The experimental\nsetting and the model selection scheme is the same as iterative DPO, except that the loss\nfunction is the IPO loss (4.10) . For fair comparison, hyperparameters for IPO is also selected\nby evaluation using the average PairRM win-rate on the hold-out subset of Ultrafeedback.\n\u2022Self-rewarding LM: Yuan et al. (2024) proposed to prompt the LLM itself as a preference\njudge to construct new preference pairs and iteratively fine-tune the LLM with the DPO\nalgorithm. We use the AlpacaEval 2.0 win rate reported by Yuan et al. (2024) for comparison.\nNote that Self-rewarding LM is a trained from Llama 2 70B.\nBenchmarks Following previous works, we use AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024a), MT-Bench\n(Zheng et al., 2024), and Open LLM Leaderboard (Beeching et al., 2023a) as our evaluation\nbenchmarks.\n\u2022AlpacaEval 2.0 is an LLM-based automatic evaluation benchmark. It employs AlpacaFarm\n(Dubois et al., 2024b) as its prompts set composed of general human instructions. The model\nresponses and the reference response generated by GPT-4-Turbo are fed into a GPT-4-Turbo-\nbased annotator to be judged. We follow the standard approach and report the win rate over\nthe reference responses.\n\u2022MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024) is a collection of 80 high-quality multi-turn open-ended\nquestions.

You are\ngiven a dialog between 2 or more individuals. The dialog will include information\nas to the relationship between 2 of the participants. At the end, you will be asked\nto provide an answer as to the relationship of those 2 participants. In this scenario,\n\u20190\u2019 will represent a spousal relationship, \u20191\u2019 will represent siblings, and \u20192\u2019 will\nrepresent a child/parent relationship. Speaker 1: I\u2019ll be right with you. Okay?\nThanks, Wendy. Speaker 2: Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor? Speaker\n3: Ooh, so cute, that I\u2019m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye. Speaker 4:\nDr. Burke will see you know. Speaker 2: Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke\nis out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now. Speaker 4: Dr. Richard\nBurke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now. Speaker 5:\nReady? What is the relationship between Speaker 5 and Richard Burke? Output:\nMistral-7B The relationship between Speaker 5 and Richard Burke is that of a parent and\nchild, as Richard Burke is identified as the son of another character in the dialog.\nIteration 1 The relationship between Speaker 5 and Richard Burke is that of a father and\nchild. Based on the dialogue, it was revealed that Dr. Timothy Burke is the on-call\ndoctor and the son of Dr. Richard Burke.\nIteration 2 The relationship between Speaker 5 and Richard Burke is that of a father and\nchild. The conversation reveals that Dr. Timothy Burke is the on-call doctor and\nhe is identified as the son of Dr. Richard Burke.\nIteration 3 Speaker 5 is the individual asking about the relationship, so they are not directly\nrelated to Dr. Richard Burke. The information provided in the dialog reveals\nthat Dr. Timothy Burke is the on-call doctor and the son of Dr. Richard Burke.\nTherefore, the answer is: The relationship between Speaker 5 and Dr. Richard\nBurke is that of a child (Dr. Timothy Burke) and parent. Speaker 5 is inquiring\nabout the relationship, but they are not themselves a part of it. The specified\nrelationship codes (0 for spousal, 1 for sibling, 2 for child/parent) align with\nthis description: Speaker 5 (0, 1, or 2) and Dr. Richard Burke (2) connect as a\nparent-child duo. Output: 2 (child/parent relationship) In this scenario, Speaker\n5\u2019s role is to determine the relationship between herself and Dr. Richard Burke,\nbut since they are not related (she is an outside inquirer), the correct answer\npertains only to the relationship identified within the dialog: Dr. Richard Burke\n(father) and Dr. Timothy Burke (son).\n20\nTable 5: Another generation example of our fine-tuned model by SPPO at different iterations.\nPrompt Q: Context: Roman Brady is a fictional character from the long running NBC soap\nopera, Days of Our Lives.

datasets and tasks for evaluating the performance of fine-tuned language models. It mentions the use of LoRAX, a tool designed for efficient serving of fine-tuned language models, supporting dynamic adapter loading and multiple model families. The tasks are categorized into five types: Classic NLP, Coding, Knowledge, Reasoning, and Math, each with specific datasets and metrics for evaluation. The datasets are accessible via platforms like Kaggle and HuggingFace, and include tasks like SQL generation, content moderation, and multiple-choice questions across various domains. The section also provides detailed information about each task, including the dataset used, the metric for evaluation, and the distribution of token counts. Additionally, there is a mention of a hypothetical example involving CNet Technology to illustrate the type of article classification task.", "section_summary": "The section discusses the application of Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Large Language Models (LLMs).
